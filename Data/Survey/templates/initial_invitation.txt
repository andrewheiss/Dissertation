Hello,

I'm a doctoral student at Duke University in the United States and I am
conducting a research project about international NGOs and the laws and
regulations of the countries they work in. I'm interested in learning about the
work {0} has done internationally and am hoping that you will be willing
to share some of your observations with me.

I have created a short 15-minute survey to help with this research. Your
responses may reveal important and useful insights that can benefit other NGOs,
so your participation would be incredibly helpful. If you are interested, I'll
share a summary of the results with you once the survey is complete. All your
responses will remain anonymous.

You can access the survey at https://www.ingoresearch.org/ or
https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_abHCZewmEEJZLZb. I would be so grateful
if you could complete the survey by **{1}**.

If you don't like taking surveys, or if you would rather speak via phone or
Skype, I would love to talk with you to learn more about your organization's
experiences. Reply to this e-mail and we can schedule a one-on-one conversation
if you have time.

If you feel unqualified to answer the survey questions, could you please let me
know if there is a particular person in your office who would be willing to
complete the survey or speak with me?

Thanks!
