Egypt underwent monumental political changes in 2011. On January 25, the Arab Spring uprising shook the country as millions took to the streets, chanting *al-shaʿb yurīd isqāṭ al-niẓām!*—"the people want the fall of the regime!" After 18 days of dramatic protests, Ḥosni Mubarak—the country's president for nearly 30 years—resigned and turned the reigns of government over to an interim military council. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, was charged with overseeing the formation of a new parliament by the end of the year. The initial January uprising was dramatic and bloody, with an estimated death toll of 800–1,000,[^1] and the unrest continued unabated under SCAF. In 2011, prisons filled as the new government convicted nearly 12,000 civilians in special military tribunals [@hrw:2011]. Anti-SCAF protests continued in Cario's Tahrir Square throughout the year, culminating in a massacre of 28 Coptic Christians holding a sit-in in front of the state media headquarters in October, weeks before the first round of parliamentary elections.[^2] 

In this atmosphere of uncertainty, unrest, and repression, on the evening of December 29, 2011—a week after the second round of elections—heavily armed Egyptian state police launched an impressively coordinated operation against multiple sites in Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, Asyut, and other cities across the country. These operations were not targeted at local protesters or dissidents, though. State security simultaneously raided the offices of Western human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that the government had invited to monitor and assist with the ongoing elections: Freedom House, the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI).[^3] In the hours-long raids, police arrested multiple staff members and confiscated equipment, documents, supplies, and cash from each NGO. The raids set off a wave of anti-NGO legal action and legislation, leading to the prosecution and sentencing *in absentia* of 44 NGO workers the following year [@Loveluck:2013] and the closure and exodus of dozens of domestic and international NGOs (INGOs). The legal environment for civil society organizations in post-revolutionary Egypt rapidly closed, and anti-NGO sentiment continues to foment in the country today.

The INGO raids in Cairo are part of a growing global phenomenon of closing civic space. Prior to his speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2013, US president Barack Obama convened a special roundtable event with representatives from 27 countries and civil society organizations. During this meeting, the participants discussed how to respond to increasingly restrictive civil society regulations in repressive regimes around the world. Obama observed:

> Unfortunately, though, what we're also seeing is a growing number of countries that are passing laws designed specifically to stifle civil society. They're forcing groups to register with governments, eroding human rights protections, restricting NGOs from accessing foreign funding, cracking down on communications technologies that connect civil society groups around the globe. In more extreme cases, activists and journalists have been arrested on false charges, and some have been killed. We're also seeing new and fragile democracies cracking down on civil society, which I believe sets them back and sends a dangerous signal to other countries [@Obama:2013].

The roundtable issued a joint statement declaring these governments' commitment to promoting the right to association and assembly, promising to "work in concert over the coming year to ensure a robust, effective international response to the proliferation of restrictions being placed on civil society" [@wh-cs:2013]. In a speech at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in New York a year later, Obama repeated his call for an international response, declaring that crackdowns on civil society "undermine the very idea of democracy" [@Obama:2014]. Subsequently, in 2014, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) partnered with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), and several other prominent INGOs to launch the Global Civil Society Legal Enabling Environment Program (LEEP). With support from the US government, the LEEP initiative was designed to strengthen civil society rights "by providing technical assistance, helping in-country partners enhance their capacity on civil society law, and undertaking research on cutting edge legal issues affecting civil society" [@icnl:2014]. The program informed USAID policy, producing guidelines for NGOs working in closed spaces [@usaid:2014], and contributed to in-depth research conducted by ICNL and the Carnegie Endowment.[^4] 

Despite these international efforts to expand civic space around the world and stem the tide of anti-NGO regulations, the legal environment for civil society organizations is becoming increasingly restricted. Crackdowns and restrictions on NGOs have increased in frequency and severity. In 2015, Russia passed its Undesirable Organizations law, giving the government the ability to blacklist any foreign or international organization working in Russia and force them to shut down. In January 2017, China's new Foreign NGO law took effect, prohibiting organizations from engaging in any form of political activity and imposing additional financial and regulatory burdens on NGOs working in the country. In May 2017, Egyptian president ʿAbd al-Fattāḥ al-Sīsī signed legislation that had sat in draft form since the 2011 uprising, imposing harsh jail sentences for any foreign NGO undertaking political activities or operating without paying a $16,500 registration fee. Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bahrain, and other authoritarian regimes have passed similar restrictive NGO laws in recent years. 

![CIVICUS Monitor civic space ratings, 2017](../../Output/figures/0-civicus-map){#fig:civicus-map}

In its 2017 report on global civic space, CIVICUS found that only 3% of the world's population lives in open societies with minimal restrictions on associational activity [@CIVICUS:2017], with the majority living in countries with obstructed or repressed civic space (see @fig:civicus-map).[^5] Restrictions are not limited to autocracies. In 2013 Canada marginalized and attempted to revoke the charitable status of several civil society organizations working on environmental issues [@CIVICUS:2013, 7], while in 2017 Israel denied access to Human Rights Watch and other watchdog human rights INGOs [@hrw:2017]. In the same report, CIVICUS added the United States to its civic space watchlist, noting:

> Since Donald Trump's election in the USA, media freedoms have been significantly damaged by the President's vilification of mainstream media houses, while a growing number of states pass or prepare new laws to curtail protest rights [@CIVICUS:2017, 11]. 

However, amid this growing global crackdown on civil society, many authoritarian regimes allow INGOs to work in their countries. Dictatorships often invite foreign election monitoring INGOs to observe their election [@Kelley:2012]—Freedom House, NDI, and IRI were originally in Egypt at the government's request. INGOs assist with humanitarian crises in highly closed countries like North Korea, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka [@Walton:2015], and China allows Greenpeace, a notoriously contentious environmental advocacy INGO, to run an office in Beijing [@Teets:2014]. The global contraction of civic space, especially in authoritarian regimes, raises several crucial questions. Why are authoritarian regimes closing off space for associational life? What is causing them to restrict civil society and target foreign NGOs? Why are some INGOs allowed (or in some cases, even invited) to remain in their countries?

The space for civil society does indeed appear to be closing, but restrictions on INGO activities do not necessarily lead to a cessation of their programs—some INGOs find creative ways to work around legal restrictions to continue their work. For example, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) had worked in Egypt since 1993 as a think tank, research center, and hub for human rights advocacy for the larger Middle East, encouraging governments throughout the region to adopt laws that adhere to international human rights standards. After the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, it expanded its work and became involved in post-revolutionary political reforms in Egypt, Tunisia, and elsewhere in the region. Between 2012–2014, however, the legal environment for INGOs working Egypt became increasingly restricted and CIHRS faced significant threats and legal pressure to end its research—workshops for regional activists were postponed because attendees were detained and deported at the airport, and funding from abroad was severely limited. In response to this closed legal space, in December 2014 CIHRS moved its regional and international operations to its newly registered offices in Tunisia.[^6] Civic space had closed in Egypt, but CIHRS found a way around the restrictions and now continues to engage in research throughout the region, including in Egypt.

In Venezuela, a much smaller INGO found different ways around restrictions. In 2014, newly elected president Nicolas Maduro confronted a deep economic recession with widespread political oppression, arresting hundreds of protesters and killing dozens of dissidents. Amid the crackdown on civic space, prices for food and medicine skyrocketed, further exacerbating the crisis. International aid agencies, however, were generally barred from the country. A group of Venezuelan-Americans founded El Programa de Ayuda Humanitaria para Venezuela (PAHPV)—a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Florida—as a response to the growing humanitarian crisis.[^7] Barred from setting up an office in Venezuela proper, PAHPV holds regular campaigns in Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina (the home states of many of their volunteers) to collect donated medical equipment, over-the-counter medicine, and basic first aid supplies. Lacking official legal status in the country, and thus prohibited from formally importing humanitarian aid to the country, PAHPV tries to work with Venezuelan NGOs to obtain proper permits for importing goods. When unable to obtain permission, PAHPV volunteers fly to Caracas as tourists, carrying supplies and cash in their luggage and passing the conditions on to local NGOs upon arrival. Civic space in Venezuela is closed to foreigners, but PAHPV and similar organizations have still found their way in.

Lifting Hands International (LHI), a small single-employee INGO based in the United States,  offers another example of creativity in spite of closing space. LHI works in France, Greece, Jordan, and Serbia to provide social services to refugees displaced by the ongoing civil war in Syria.[^8] In Greece, LHI partners with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Greek government to coordinate the delivery of food, medical supplies, and education in one refugee camp. In May and June of 2017, however, the government in Athens diverted UNHCR funds away from its partner NGOs, directing them instead to municipal governments. The central government also instituted an onerous new registration process for any NGOs trying to work inside refugee camps, and despite multiple attempts (and regular contacts with the US State Department and members of the Greek parliament), LHI lost access to its camp. Unable to work in its assigned camp, LHI began teaching classes and distributing supplies in a local park down the street from the main camp.[^9]

CIHRS, PAHPV, and LHI are only a handful of examples of INGOs adapting and adjusting their programs in the service of their core missions, in spite of closing civic space—hundreds of other organizations face similar regulatory dilemmas and decide how to respond to increasing government oversight of their programs. However, these adjustments impose significant organizational costs. CIHRS still engages in human rights advocacy in Egypt, but with a substantially limited scope and far fewer programs. PAHPV continues to bring medical supplies to Venezuela, but only in small batches at an enormous cost, since items must enter the country in suitcases with paid travelers. In the face of regulations designed to capture UNHCR funds for the Greek government, LHI has significantly reduced the amount of services and programs it provides in its refugee camp. Civic space *is* closing around the world, and NGOs *are* adapting, but not all adapt equally or with the same success.

The global crackdown on civic space and INGOs' subsequent adaptation presents a fascinating puzzle. Though the services and advocacy provided by INGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of the regime, autocratic states allow many INGO activities, and INGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions. In this dissertation, I theorize that the relationship between INGOs and autocrats creates a state of *amicable contempt*, where each party is aware that the other both threatens and supports their existence.

Autocrats see global civil society as a strategic player in their domestic political landscape. International NGOs can help autocrats maintain regime stability and remain in power by providing services and expertise, bestowing a sheen of international legitimacy and reputation, and offset domestic institutional challenges. At the same time, though, INGOs pose a risk to autocrats. Their missions and goals might conflict with the regime—for instance, a human rights INGO might condemn a leader who relies on torture to control dissidents. To address this dilemma, autocrats use specific and careful strategies for enjoying the political, social, and other practical benefits of INGOs while simultaneously offsetting the costs and risks of letting these organizations operate in their country. One of their primary methods for controlling INGOs is through regulation and restriction.

International NGOs understand this contentious relationship with their host countries and work to adjust and adapt to the political environment. Parallel to the cost-benefit calculus of their host governments, INGOs seek to balance their need to pursue their work (often in opposition to the regime) against the risk of acting as a political pawn of the regime and propping it up. Rather than passively accepting the regulatory environment imposed on them, INGOs work to either shape that environment or adjust their programs and strategies to maintain access to the country. Because of the costs involved in confronting and adapting to their regulatory environment, not all INGOs are able to make these adjustments, and organizations often adjust to fit regime preferences or exit the country.

Anti-NGO regulations are increasing worldwide and the space for civic space and associational life is contracting. But these new regulations have not completely ended global civil society—autocrats will continue to benefit from NGOs, and many NGOs will continue to adjust creatively to remain attractive and active. In this complicated state of amicable contempt, with both parties reacting and adjusting, who wins? When can regimes reap the benefits of INGO programming? What determines whether an INGO can avoid co-optation *and* remain actively engaged in a country? How do INGOs adapt? And how does this adaptation affect their strategies? Does it fundamentally change the organizations themselves, and can autocrats keep the upper hand?

# Dictators and activists: Reluctant bedfellows

Today, nearly 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, early optimism for a global "third wave" of democratization—the rapid transition of the world's last remaining autocracies to liberal democracy—appears quite quixotic. Although most authoritarian regimes hold democratic elections [@LevitskyWay:2010], allow for multiparty legislatures [@Blaydes:2011], empower an independent judiciary [@GinsburgMoustafa:2008], or use independent central banks to set monetary policy [@Boylan:2001], authoritarianism remains durable. Instead of democratizing, dictatorships don "democratic garb" [@Brownlee:2007, 25] and delegate authority to other domestic institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. 

Little research, however, has attempted to explain authoritarian treatment of domestic and transnational civil society through a similar institutional lens. By viewing civil society as yet another institutional actor that autocrats have to balance, we can begin to answer crucial questions: Why do self-interested autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their borders, and what determines how autocrats regulate civil society in their borders?

## Authoritarian institutional balancing

Dictators are rarely omnipotent or invulnerable. Autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], a phenomenon I term *institutional balancing* (see @fig:balancing). This theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that autocrats are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

![Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors](../../Graphics/balancing){#fig:balancing}

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can establish narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage, or create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to generate popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their power] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this dissonance creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

## Civil society as a political institution

In addition to traditional regime-constraining political institutions like elections, judicial systems, and legislatures, we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into authoritarian politics by looking at civil society through an institutionalist lens. The idea of a civil society has long been salient in political science, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),[^10] or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. Regimes must contend with, balance out, and adapt to these organizations in order to survive.

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These sets of rules create equilibria and structure the relationships between rival political actors, dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51; @Knight:2002, 126]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction and help actors achieve Pareto efficiency. Additionally, institutions can help foster trust between actors—when players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.[^11] 

Conceptualizing civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs relate to the states they work in. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.[^12] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state and reinforces the equilibrium between state and society.[^13] 

Others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

The fact that the denouncement of grievances is a public good is key to civil society's role as a social focal point. @Ostrom:1990 convincingly argues that social norms (defined as institutions) allow communities to police and regulate common-pool resources—rival but non-excludable goods that behave similar to more traditional public goods. To prevent overfishing, communities of Turkish fishermen developed detailed social norms to dictate where fishing is permissible on which days by which fishermen. Without those norms, an aggrieved fisherman whose area on a lake is depleted by a rival has no recourse; with these norms, the fisherman has recourse to social shaming, stigma, and compensation. Similarly, a single aggrieved citizen alone cannot directly challenge the state or a firm with much efficacy. However, institutional structures allow them to address those grievances, thus providing the public good of engagement with the state. 

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how institutions can provide this public good, arguing that institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state. This, in turn, can redefine the equilibrium between the two actors, as states seek to regulate and reshape their relationship to civil society organizations that pose potential threats to their ideal preferences.

It is more useful, however, to move beyond the normative debates over these two extremes of civil society skepticism (that it serves only to build the state) and civil society utopianism (that it serves only to protect against the state) and instead treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. A key implication of this argument is that the relationship between institutions within a state is rarely unidirectional—any political institution can either act independently or be acted upon by other institutions, such as the ruling regime, legislature, or private sector. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, civil society can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival. 

# International NGOs: yet another actor to be balanced

Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior [@Linos:2013; @Slaughter:2004]. Similar to their domestic counterparts, international NGOs can provide particularly acute pressure against authoritarian regimes, especially as they work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. Domestic NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again [@Keck:1998]. 

With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. @RisseSikkink:1999 describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. Domestic actors repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.

Relying on non-state actors as part of stability-seeking institutional balancing is fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards in authoritarian regimes [@DeMars:2005]. INGOs have real effects on domestic politics and policies and pose significant risks to the regimes that allow them to operate. Previous research has found that countries receiving negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows [@BarryClayFlynn:2013] and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms [@Murdie:2012]. Close networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012].

![Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions](../../Output/figures/0-ingos-dictatorships){#fig:ingos-dictatorships}

In spite of the risks of dealing with INGOs, authoritarians are increasingly opening up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a show that in general, institutionalization in authoritarian regimes has increased substantially since 1970, as dictatorships permit pseudo-democratic electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In @fig:ingos-dictatorships I replicate their work and add a fourth indicator to measure the institutionalization of INGOs in dictatorships. The figure shows the percentage of dictatorships where more than 500 INGOs report having members.[^14] Since the 1980s, international associational life has grown to become a nearly universal feature of autocratic rule—by 2004, 90% of dictatorships had at least 500 INGOs with registered members in their countries.

## Controlling civic space to curtail INGO influence

Though associational life has increased, regimes have worked to control its expansion by imposing formal and informal restrictions on INGO activity. In a survey I conducted with Judith Kelley [@HeissKelley:2016; @Kelley:2017], 480 human trafficking NGOs answered questions about their work in 133 different countries, and 24% reported feeling either somewhat or very restricted by the governments of 66 different countries. The nature of these restrictions varied, ranging from strict legal requirements to general government antagonism or apathy toward INGO programming. For example, one INGO working in Southeast Asia reported "[a]ll work must be approved and done in direct concert with government counterparts. [Our] presence in country [is] controlled and evaluated by government officials, even those who are not familiar with our work,"[^15] while another stated that "we had to be certified and continue to submit to monthly reporting, mandatory financial audits, site visits, social welfare approval, government regulations regarding our aftercare property, work permits for all foreign volunteers, annual reporting and additional certifications."[^16] Some NGOs responded that informal restrictions, such as corruption and inefficiency in the police and government bureaucracy, also limit the programming these organizations can do in-country. The responses from this survey led me to investigate this phenomenon further, and in 2016 I conducted a survey of more than 600 INGOs working in 148 countries.[^17] I found similar results—19% of responding INGOs reported feeling moderately to extremely restricted across 72 different countries, and many respondents complained of government intrusion into their programs. 

One recurring theme in both these surveys is INGOs' observation that government restrictions are calibrated to help the regime, such that "[a]ll of our work is seen through the lens of … party priorities."[^18] Sovereign nations engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so "allows the regime to (1) shore up its authority and legitimacy and to (2) deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8, *numbers added*]. Autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. For example, because competition for foreign patronage created an absence of strong links between Russian advocacy groups and the public, the Russian state has been able to restructure the civil society sector so that only NGOs that "work on issues that align with the national interest" receive funding and support [@Henderson:2010, 254], short-circuiting international "spiral" pressure and silencing domestic advocacy movements. 

Authoritarian regimes will also use INGOs and other non-state actors to improve their international reputations. @Kelley:2012 argues that because election monitoring has become a global norm, governments—even those who fully intend on cheating and manipulating the election—permit election monitoring INGOs as a way of appearing credible and democratic to peer nations. To ensure that monitoring efforts do indeed improve the regime's reputation, authoritarian governments will try to circumvent international monitors or purposely invite friendly (or bribable) monitors to counterbalance more objective organizations. Because of this, election monitors can ultimately "contribute to the false legitimization of governments" [@Kelley:2012, 155]. 

These rational strategies have the potential to backfire, however, since authoritarians are rarely able to fully control all rival actors. Though inviting election monitors can provide substantial reputational benefits, research has found that the presence of high-quality monitors can make it more difficult to cheat and is associated with better election quality, fewer violations of electoral law, and more incumbent turnover [@Kelley:2012, 124]—rulers in competitive authoritarian regimes can lose monitored elections. In post-revolutionary Egypt, international human rights monitoring organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have benefitted from increased operational latitude as the different regimes have sought to bolster their international reputation. With this greater flexibility, these organizations have been able to issue dozens of reports condemning the government for its human rights abuses. Increased transnational oversight into Egyptian human rights has led to increased international shaming and condemnation.

## What influences INGO behavior?

As seen above, institutional theory provides a helpful lens for understanding why authoritarian regimes work with civil society organizations and invite INGOs to their countries. Regimes factor these organizations into their stability-seeking calculus and can either take advantage of INGO programs or expel INGOs to head off the risk of instability. Thinking institutionally is also useful for analyzing INGO responses to authoritarian regulations. The political, social, economic, cultural, and regulatory environments INGOs work in play a central role in shaping organizational strategy and behavior.

INGOs have long been treated as a "black box" in much of the existing academic work on international institutions, and have often been assumed to act as altruistic bulwarks against the state, filling policy and issue gaps in the international system, and run by managers with only the best intentions [@Corry:2010; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @NyeKeohane:1971; @Bartelson:2006]. In the past decade, however, scholars have worked to move beyond this simplistic view and uncover the determinants and effects of INGO behavior, looking at transnational actors as both normative and strategic [@Cooley:2002; @Keck:1999; @Kelley:2009a]. @PrakashGugerty:2010a helped formalize this newer trend, arguing that advocacy INGOs should be seen as firms working in policy markets, driven by normative and instrumental concerns, and motivated organizational survival and growth. Seen in this more nuanced light, it is clear that, like firms, INGOs are subject to interagency conflicts, face issues with accountability, compete for scarce resources, and struggle to get their issues on the global agenda. Tana Johnson and I [-@HeissJohnson:2016] provide a useful typology for this newer body of work (summarized in @fig:ISR-pyramid), which organizes these emerging structural determinants of INGO behavior into three related and interlocking categories: (1) the internal structure of the INGO, (2) the external dynamics and relationships faced by the INGO, and (3) the institutional context that defines the boundaries of INGO action. 

![A unified framework for analyzing INGO behavior [@HeissJohnson:2016]](../../Graphics/ISR-pyramid){#fig:ISR-pyramid}

## Internal traits

A significant portion of INGO behavior is shaped by the preferences and ideals of its managers, employees, and volunteers, who in turn shape the organization's stated mission, vision, and values. Substantial research on nonprofit management looks precisely at how organizations can optimize their managerial structure [@Brown:2010; @HermanRenz:2004], improve relationships with their boards [@Renz:2004; @Renz:2010a], effectively and ethically manage donations from individuals, corporations, governments, and foundations [@Young:2010; @Smith:2006; @Kerlin:2006], train employees and volunteers [@WatsonAbzug:2010], and clearly articulate their vision through a well-crafted mission statement [@Sheehan:1996]. These internal traits of NGOs influence the success of their programming. For instance, @Wong:2012 shows that INGOs can centralize or decentralize different forms of managerial power: the power to propose new goals and missions, the power to enforce those goals, and the power to actually implement those proposals. Organizations that successfully centralize proposal power while decentralizing implementation power are better able to pursue a central agenda without stifling local creativity, thus leading to better success [@Wong:2012].

## Interactions with other actors

INGOs do not work alone. Even if an organization perfectly balances and refines its internal managerial structure, it still must interact with third-party actors as it pursues its policy agenda. An INGO's interactions with these other external actors shape its behavior. Early work on opening the INGO black box focused on many of these external factors. For example, @Cooley:2002 argue that competition among INGOs actually leads to perverse outcomes and sectoral insecurity, as organizations will often undermine their competitors, withhold information, act unilaterally, and seek government rents. Additionally, Clifford Bob shows that INGOs compete in a "harsh, Darwinian marketplace where legions of desperate groups vie for scarce attention, sympathy, and money" [@Bob:2002, 37]. Organizations that are experts at emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and craft their messages to fit Western sensibilities are far more effective in the global community than their competitors. 

The relationships that form as organizations interact also have a direct impact on INGO power and influence. @Carpenter:2014 demonstrates the importance of the shape and nature of INGO networks. INGOs are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be. @Murdie:2014 provides additional evidence of the power of INGO networks, finding that human rights INGOs that network and collaborate together increase their advocacy output. The nature of these network relationships influences the quality of this work, though—as more organizations free ride and rely on larger, more prominent INGOs, advocacy output decreases.

## Institutional environment

Beyond the influence of internal and external actors, INGOs are also shaped by more ephemeral concepts—the political structures and institutions they interact with [@HeissJohnson:2016; @GugertyPrakash:2010; @BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. INGOs are products of the legal regulations, historical precedents, political trends, and cultural norms of both their home countries and the countries they target, all of which define the boundaries for INGO operations. 

In contrast with internal NGO traits and interactions with other actors, the effect of the institutional environment on international NGOs is relatively understudied [@BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. @Stroup:2012 shows that the organizational structures and missions of INGOs are deeply tied to the cultural and legal environments of their home countries. For example, she argues that CARE USA's mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. Additionally, because Amnesty International refuses government funding (in part because of the historical absence of government funding for charities), it focuses much of its advocacy work on British and American human rights abuses. 

Emerging research on domestic nonprofit organizations in the United States can inform future research into INGO behavior, revealing how NGOs both (1) are adversely affected by the rules, regulations, and institutional structures governing NGO activities, and (2) manipulate those structures for their own benefit and organizational survival. First, institutional rules and norms can create inefficiencies in nonprofit programming. For instance, NGOs often change their behavior to obtain funding from governments and private donors. Government grants can crowd out and replace private donations [@KimVan-Ryzin:2014] and their strict reporting requirements can shift nonprofit priorities towards bureaucratic compliance and away from their core missions [@Suarez:2011; @Bush:2015]. Additionally, nonprofits are highly responsive to shifting donor demands and can modify their stated missions in pursuit of consistent funding streams [@AbouAssi:2013; @AbouAssiTschirhart:2017]. Programmatic and strategic demands from donors can lead to suboptimal outcomes. For instance, government grant requirements often insist that applicant organizations pursue specific behaviors, such as collaboration with other organizations, even if collaboration is not the optimal strategy for the organization. In fact, because of this push for collaboration, regardless of its consequences, one of the best predictors of a nonprofit organization receiving government funding is whether or not it collaborates with other nonprofits [@Suarez:2008; @Suarez:2011]. As these organizations create inefficient collaborative networks, organizational objectives and missions are often dropped or discarded in pursuit of additional funding, resulting in a market failure [@WitesmanHeiss:2016]. These inefficiencies are directly tied to the structural incentives to collaborate, pushing organizations to adopt suboptimal strategies in the interest of securing funding. Foreign NGOs suffer similar inefficiencies and crowding out effects [@GugertyKremer:2008], but work remains for research on international NGOs.

Second, rather than shift and adjust their organizational missions and values to fit the legal environment, many American nonprofits maneuver *within* that environment and find workarounds for their preferred strategies. That is, nonprofits in the United States generally do not change their missions—they change their legal and organizational structures to make their missions happen.[^19] In the United States, nonprofits typically incorporate initially as 501(c)(3) organizations. While this designation provides significant tax benefits (i.e. full tax exemption), IRS regulations restrict some of the activities and income generation strategies these organizations can pursue. In order to become more politically engaged, nonprofits will often create a 501(c)(4) or (c)(6) subsidiary, which offers fewer tax benefits but allows for direct political advocacy. Similarly, IRS regulations impose an operational test on nonprofits' business activities. If an organization generates significant unrelated business income (UBI) it can fail this test and lose its exempt status. To prevent this from happening, 501(c)(3)s can spin off for-profit subsidiaries that channel income into the main organization [@Daniel:2014; @SloanGrizzleKim:2015]. Ultimately, US nonprofits learn to deftly maneuver the legal regulatory environment to maximize their revenue and carry out their preferred programs.[^20] 

Like their domestic counterparts, international NGOs also engage in creative and strategic adjustments, taking advantage of the legal environment to shape their programming and protect their resources and funding. However, international NGOs working in dictatorships face especially difficult choices. Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong explains this dilemma: 

> To work around [authoritarian] restrictions NGOs can work on less sensitive topics, with friendly government officials, partner with local organisations and try to [find] funding sources that aren't considered "sensitive." All of that is being done very creatively by many on the ground. But, we have to ask ourselves whether doing so might compromise one's original intentions. Helping the government maintain the status quo in some ways undermines long-term prospects, as ultimately civil society does need a free press, a democratic government and freedom of association [@Leach:2014].

Pushing the envelope with organizational and legal innovations in these countries is a doubled-edged sword: if an INGO gets too creative in spinning off subsidiaries, partnering with domestic NGOs, or redefining its mission, it can either change its mission so much as to support the government and help keep it in power, or it can run afoul of the government and be expelled. 

# Amicable contempt: International NGOs and authoritarian regimes

The institutional environments of INGO target countries thus add an additional layer of complexity to nonprofit mission fulfillment. INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies. In addition to internal and interactive behavioral determinants, INGOs face two sources of government-based pressure, with each source ultimately influencing organizational strategy [@HeissKelley:2017]: in addition to the regulations of their home countries, INGOs must contend with the institutional effects of their target countries.  

Despite a rich and exciting literature on both authoritarian institutional balancing and nonprofit organizational behavior, little existing research in international relations or comparative politics combines the two concepts to examine how international NGOs fit into a dictator's stability-seeking calculus. Correspondingly, little nonprofit management research has looked at the effect of domestic authoritarian politics on INGO behavior. An INGO's mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic, contentious, or principled, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However if the organization is too cooperative, its selection of programs may not be credible or effective as the INGO kowtows to the dictator's demands.

I use an adaptation of negotiation theory [@Raiffa:1982; @Mayer:2010] to conceptualize this dynamic relationship between dictators and INGOs.[^21] I model the interaction between authoritarian regimes and INGOs in any given issue area (human rights, development, advocacy, etc.) in simple two-dimensional policy space (see @fig:theory-full). Each actor has a preference for a certain level of advocacy or service provision, marked as solid circles in the figure (Regime~ideal~ and INGO~ideal~). Governments set and implement *de jure* policies to prevent INGO programming from going beyond the regime's ideal point,[^22] while INGOs will engage in programming that, when possible, fits within the bounds set by the regime. In addition to these ideal points, each actor has a range of flexibility in the implementation of their regulations or their programming, shown in the horizontal lines flanking the ideal points.[^23] The space where the two preference ranges overlap[^24] determines both the regime's *de facto* level of restrictions and the INGO's actual mix of programming in that country and constitutes the practical operating environment for the INGO.

![Programming preferences in two-dimensional policy space](../../Graphics/theory-full){#fig:theory-full}

An authoritarian regime's negotiation preferences comprise two components: (1) formal *de jure* legislation and policies, represented by the ideal point, and (2) *de facto* implementation of those policies, represented by the negotiation space around the ideal point. Regimes establish a regulatory environment for international civil society that ranges in permissiveness—some countries allow for a large degree of contentious INGO activity, while others are highly restrictive and provide little room for dissonance. In turn, and analogous to the regime's preferences, an INGO's negotiation preferences comprise two components: (1) the organization's normative principles and ideals, represented by the ideal point, (2) the organization's instrumental flexibility in actually implementing those principles, represented by the negotiation space. INGOs have a desire to engage in a certain level of advocacy, generally defined by their mission, vision, and values. INGOs with more instrumental flexibility—that is, a diverse menu of programs, professionalized staff, consistent revenue streams, and collaborative relationships with governments, IGOs, foundations, and other NGOs—can fine tune their programs to fit the regulatory environments they face, while those with less flexibility are less able to make such adjustments. 

The interaction between the actors' negotiation positions introduces two additional dynamics that are crucial for determining how authoritarian regimes regulate INGOs and how well INGOs can respond correspondingly. First, the distance between the two parties ideal points determines the contentiousness of their relationship. INGOs that engage in programming close to the regime's preferences are naturally more cooperative, either providing services that the government needs or advocating for issues that are unlikely to lead to political instability. Accordingly, INGOs that are more cooperative will be *compliant* with the legal limits imposed by the regime. Organizations that pursue more contentious programming further from the regime's ideal point, on the other hand, will have an *antagonistic* relationship and will be more likely to openly resist the restrictions imposed on them.

Second, the size of the two actors' overlapping negotiation spaces determines the practical operating environment for INGOs. This space falls along a continuum of restrictiveness, ranging from *tolerance*, or very few legal or actual restrictions on INGO programs, to *expulsion*, or a complete ban of all INGO activities. The larger the practical operating environment, the more tolerant the regime will be about international NGOs working in their regimes, and vice versa—when there is no overlap, an INGO will face expulsion.

![Possible regulatory environments and regime–INGO relationships](../../Graphics/theory-grid){#fig:theory-grid}

The relationship between INGOs and authoritarian regimes is dynamic, and shifts in INGO flexibility and de factor regime civil society regulations can lead to a variety of different practical operating environments, demonstrated in @fig:theory-grid. The majority of INGOs throughout the world report feeling few restrictions in their target countries. Recall that 24% of the global human trafficking survey respondents [@HeissKelley:2016] and 19% of the respondents to my global INGO survey report feeling restricted by their host governments—by extension, 75–80% of INGOs do *not* feel restricted. This does not mean, however, that all INGOs are inherently more cooperative with host regime preferences. According to this model of amicable contempt, there are two circumstances where INGOs will feel less restricted. First, as seen in the top left quadrant of @fig:theory-grid, if the distance between the two parties' ideal points is short and the negotiation spaces overlap—as with INGOs providing non-contentious programming like disaster relief, humanitarian services, or education—INGOs will be compliant and cooperative and face a tolerant operating environment.  Because of preference alignment, these INGOs will not need to rely on their flexibility to maintain access to their host countries. 

More contentious organizations with preferences that diverge from the regime's ideal point, on the other hand, can also face a tolerant environment as long as they have a large amount of instrumental flexibility (see bottom left quadrant of @fig:theory-grid). At the extreme, INGOs with enormous foreign political backing and funding can completely dominate government preferences and marginalize weaker states. For instance, in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while some INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012]. More often, though, INGOs do not gain control over their host regimes. Instead, as chapters 5 and 6 will show, advocacy organizations like Article 19 and IRI can advocate for democratization, political reform, and increased respect for human rights by relying on networks of field offices, funded by dozens of private foundations and government grants—resources that give these organizations the flexibility to remain in their host countries and maintain a fairly tolerant operating environment.

Likewise, there are two circumstances where INGOs will feel restricted, or even expelled. Most often, organizations that face restricted operating environments engage in contentious programming and work in countries where regimes have limited de facto regulatory environments, leaving little room for negotiation or overlap (see bottom right quadrant of @fig:theory-grid). Highly contentious organizations like Amnesty International and Index on Censorship (explored in depth in chapter 6) can work effectively from abroad to draw attention to human rights abuses. In contrast, INGOs that are naturally less contentious and more prone to compliance can face expulsion if they lack flexibility or it the civil society regulatory environment is too constrained (see top right quadrant of @fig:theory-grid). Though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for the disabled [@Chin:2015]. Importantly, an INGO's flexibility and a regime's civil society regulatory environment are not static, and changes in these negotiation spaces can lead to unexpected changes in the practical operating environment. Organizations that work in countries that face sudden changes to the civil society regulatory environment can unexpectedly find themselves expelled. For example, dramatic shifts in Egypt's de facto civil society regulatory environment following the 2011 uprising led to the expulsion of many international NGOs. In chapter 5 I will explore how the practical operating environment for AMERA Egypt / UK / International—a small INGO working with refugees in Cairo—moved from tolerance to expulsion despite its low contention programing. Meanwhile, in chapter 6 I will show how IRI—a far more contentious democracy promotion INGO—also faced expulsion from its Egyptian field offices amid post-revolutionary unrest, but was able to continue its mission from abroad because of its instrumental flexibility. 

# Hypotheses and roadmap

By framing the relationship between INGOs and governments as a negotiation, I can generate hypotheses and testable implications based on different elements of the amicable contempt model.

As described previously, the nature of authoritarian institutional balancing takes on many forms and is done with different purposes. Dictators will co-opt legislatures to dole out the benefits of regime patronage to the elites and allow for better, more reliable monitoring of elite loyalty [@Blaydes:2011]; capture or co-opt domestic civil society organizations to enhance service provision and citizen monitoring; or tacitly permit controlled popular protests to give citizens an outlet to vent their dissatisfaction with the government [@Chen:2012] or signal state intentions during international negotiations [@Weiss:2013]. Each of these pseudo-democratic domestic institutions (elections, civil society, state-sanctioned popular protests) enhance regime stability. I contend that, just as they do with other domestic actors and institutions, dictators must also carefully balance and contend with international NGOs, maximizing the optimum level of foreign-based advocacy in their countries without causing domestic instability.

Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance is the autocrat's ability to manage and control these external actors. When dealing with domestic challengers and institutions, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have a more limited menu of policy options for controlling international actors, however, because of their nationality. While it maybe be easy to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempts to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers are far more risky, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. Though there are a handful of instances of authoritarian regimes attempting to formally prosecute foreigners (see, for instance, the December 2011 raid on Freedom House, IRI, and NDI), dictators generally only have one type of policy lever to control INGOs: increasing or decreasing legal restrictions related to INGO advocacy and service provision.

I thus argue that the size of an autocrat's civil society regulatory environment is directly related to the regime's need for stability, leading to my first general hypothesis—*when authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, they can risk expanding their regulatory environments and allow for more dissonance.* Conversely, when facing increased pressure from other institutional actors, the space allowed for civil society will shrink and regimes will be more likely to shift their ideal points away from NGO preferences. This hypothesis leads to two testable implications, each tied to an element of the theoretical model:

- The de facto civil society regulatory environment (i.e. the negotiation space around the regime's ideal point) will be more restrictive in reaction to regime instability.
- Formal de jure legislation restricting international civil society (i.e. the regime's ideal point) will be passed in reaction to instability.

I test each of these implications in chapters 2 and 3 using an integrative mixed methods approach, nesting small-*n* case study analysis within a large-*n* statistical exploration of the theory's mechanisms [@Lieberman:2005]. In chapter 2, I use a set of statistical models to test the effect of regime stability on the de facto civil society regulatory environment in 100 autocracies between 1991–2014. I divide the broad notion of "regime stability" into three types. First, I examine *internal stability*, or the degree to which a regime (1) can overcome tensions between government elite and maintain regime cohesiveness, and (2) can confront corruption, ethnic tensions, protests, and other broader domestic conflicts. A highly internally stable regime entails tight regime cohesiveness and low levels of domestic conflict. Second, I look at the effect of *external stability*, or the amount of pressure a regime faces from foreign countries. In particular, I argue that domestic unrest in a country's neighboring countries can threaten to spillover and affect an autocrat's institutional balance. Third, I consider the effect of *international reputation*, under the assumption that regimes often care about how they are perceived by the international community. A strong and positive international reputation can act as a signal of regime cohesion and stability to an autocrat's domestic audiences, and publicly cracking down on rival institutions like civil society runs a risk of harming reputation. 

The statistical models in chapter 2 only test how notions of stability influence the de facto civil society regulatory environment. In chapter 3, I use the results of these models to inform the selection of three countries—Egypt, Russia, and China—for deeper small-*n* case study analysis. In these case studies, I examine both elements of the regime's negotiating position simultaneously. First, because the results of the statistical model contradict some of my hypotheses, I continue to explore the relationship between a country's de facto civil society regulatory environment and internal, external, and reputational threats to stability. Second, I trace the development of each country's set of INGO-related de jure regulations and explore how the same threats to stability shape an autocrat's decision to formally shift its preferences for INGO action. Ultimately I find that formal legal regulations are rarely applied universally, and instead serve as a signal of an autocrat's intention to control or limit INGO programs. Formal laws give autocrats the ability to employ significant discretion when confronting NGOs, providing them with a menu of legal and administrative options to limit potentially destabilizing civil society action.

Chapters 2 and 3 focus exclusively on the regime's side of the amicable contempt model, looking only at the factors that shape a government's ideal point and negotiation space. This sets the stage for examining the relationship between autocrats and INGOs. In chapter 4, I shift the attention to the INGO side of the model and examine how the conflict between mission and money (or principles and instrumental concerns) shapes an INGO's negotiation preferences and its subsequent relationship to its host government. I also begin to explore how the two parties interact and argue that governments attempt to regulate INGOs by targeting different elements of their presences. 

Governments can mitigate the potential risks of international NGOs by employing regulations designed to filter out organizations before they enter the country and limit the scope of their activities once they establish operations. This leads to my second general hypothesis: *when authoritarian regimes perceive INGO programming as threatening, they will limit the practical operating environment by reducing INGO flexibility.* I argue that regimes rely on gatekeeping regulations—including entry, registration, and programming restrictions—to reduce INGO flexibility and make it difficult to continue working in the country. This hypothesis results in several implications:

- INGOs with more antagonistic relationships with their host governments will face more gatekeeping regulations
- INGOs with high flexibility will maintain their overlap with the civil society regulatory environment and will face a more tolerant practical operating environment
- INGOs with low flexibility will not maintain their overlap with the civil society regulatory environment and will face expulsion

I explore how INGOs respond to gatekeeping regulations in chapter 5, combining the results from a global survey of more than 600 organizations with detailed case studies of Article 19 and AMERA UK / Egypt / International. I draw on annual reports, financial statements, press releases and key informant interviews with INGO staff to examine how Article 19 and AMERA each relied on their instrumental flexibility in an attempt to maintain a tolerant practical operating environment. 

While gatekeeping regulations are primarily defensive and designed to protect the regime against the risks of INGO activity by limiting their flexibility, regimes can also be more proactive and try to take advantage of INGO missions. This leads to my third general hypothesis: *when authoritarian regimes perceive INGO programming as potentially beneficial, they will attempt to move the INGO's ideal point closer to regime preferences by targeting INGO missions.* I argue that regimes use program capture regulations like foreign funding restrictions and managerial requirements to coerce changes in INGO missions. Again, this hypotheses leads to several testable implications:

- INGOs with more antagonistic relationships with their host governments will face more program capture regulations when regimes see possible benefit in their programs
- INGOs with high flexibility will protect their missions by relying on that flexibility to resist and work around program capture laws
- INGOs with low flexibility will be unable to resist program capture laws and will either become co-opted or exit the country

I test each of these implications in chapter 6, again combining survey results with case studies of two more INGOs: Index on Censorship and the International Republican Institute (IRI). I explore how both organizations drew on their instrumental flexibility to protect their core missions in the face of unconventional government attempts at capture and co-optation. I conclude with a summary of the argument in chapter 7. 

Finally, a brief note on the scope and purpose of this theory and its empirical implications is warranted before examining the evidence. Presenting the relationship between INGOs and their host governments as a negotiation or bargaining event yields conceptual advantages. Each party has some core set of ideals or preferences and has some flexibility in pursuing those goals, whether it be how they differentially enforce laws or how they make adjustments to their programming to protect against changes to their ideals or to remain legally allowed in the country. I dedicate a chapter to defining and exploring each of these mechanisms, providing careful empirical evidence for their complexity and the conditions under which each mechanism works. Importantly, these concepts, however detailed their evidence, have limited generalizability. I do not try to make universal claims about how authoritarian governments relate to all institutional actors in their purview, nor do I try present a grand unifying theory for international NGO behavior. Authoritarian states and INGOs both vary widely in their behavior, and technically, neither actor actually "behaves"—both are organizational forms that comprise hundreds (or thousands) of individuals, each with their own preferences and behaviors. Additionally, the world is messy and complicated. It is impossible to discover every institutional, political, sociological, economic or psychological causal process that might influence organizational and governmental behavior. 

My theory of amicable contempt, in this regard, is a type of middle-range theory [@Merton:1949]. It provides a framework that allows me to engage in the messiness of complicated empirical reality and enables me to explore the reach of the theory, identifying "the parameters within which [the] theory can be expected to be valid" [@Ziblatt:2006, 9]. The model provides a helpful shorthand for exploring a salient set of dynamics that likely *do* explain government- and organization-level behavior, but its parsimony necessarily limits the causal claims I can make. I undoubtedly leave out details and make some gross simplifications, but this is by design. Simplification is necessary when looking at the complexity of politics [@LittlePepinsky:2016], and "free-floating calls for nuance, unconstrained by rules of method or logic, inhibit the process of abstraction that makes theory valuable" [@Healy:2017]. This does not mean the evidence I offer is devoid of complexity or overly simple—I still attempt to "master the details, … understand the context, and … illuminate the complexities of cases to spur better theorizing and empirical testing" [@LittlePepinsky:2016, 444]. Though the theory cannot make perfect predictions of government or INGO behavior or describe every possible reason for their actions, it does uncover important mechanisms driving the relationship between the two parties and the decisions each make, which ultimately deepens our theoretical understanding of authoritarian and INGO behavior and provides helpful policy guidance for INGOs confronting difficult regulatory environments.
