TODO

While the statistical models in the previous chapter provide some observational evidence for the internal, external, and reputational determinants of authoritarian restrictions on global civil society, there are limits to what the statistics can reveal. 


In this chapter, I analyze how the mechanisms of internal risk, external threats, and international reputation influence the development of specific laws governing international civil society, or the regime's ideal point in the model of amicable contempt (see @fig:theory-regime-dot). Based on the model


—Egypt, Russia, and China—and discover additional nuance within and evidence for each hypothesized mechanism.

# Egypt

Egypt illustrates the importance of internal regime consolidate and domestic political unrest in a dictator's decision to regulate domestic and international civil society. A persistent thread running through the development of Egypt's NGO regulatory environment is that of control—each law dealing with civil society was designed to provide maximum political benefit to the ruling party by delineating the allowable space for NGO action. The case also shows how different Egyptian regimes have prioritized civil society as a political institution. Prior to the 2011 uprising, domestic and international NGOs were treated as a low priority, something rules got around to regulating after consolidating their power and balancing out other challengers to their stability. The kinetic political environment following 2011 Mubarak's resignation, though, reshaped regime–civil society relations. International NGOs that had previously been expelled, such as the International Republican Institute (IRI), were invited back to observe elections, along with other prominent human rights INGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. After this initial and unprecedented opening of civic space, the door to international advocacy was slammed shut at the end of 2011. Fears of domestic unrest, as well as shifting internal regime cohesion, led to a dramatic constriction of the country's civil society regulatory environment. 

In this case study, I compare the predictions of the statistical model with qualitative evidence from Egypt's approach to regulating domestic and international civil society. I trace how internal factors—regime cohesion and domestic unrest—propelled the the development of Egypt's regulatory and legal system. I also briefly investigate how regional political risk from abroad—including uprisings in Palestine in 2000–2005 and the protests in Tunisia, Libya, and elsewhere in 2011—played an important (though lesser) role in shaping Egyptian civil society regulations. @fig:timeline-egy shows an overview of the variables from the statistical models since 1995, overlaid with a timeline of Egypt's different regimes and potentially destabilizing events.

## Domestic unrest and regime cohesion

According to the results of the statistical model, regimes with greater internal cohesion and longer tenure are more likely to restrict the civil society regulatory environment. One possible explanation for this unexpected prediction is that though civil society is one of many institutions dictators need to deal with, it is less important than other actors that pose more of an immediate threat. As regimes gain more power and stability, they see less of a need to leave civil society unregulated, and domestic political crises in older, consolidated regimes can lead to formal legislation that restricts civil society. The experience of Egypt offers a prime example of this dynamic.

### Civil society and internal threats to stability under Nasser

Egypt's first foray into regulating civil society in 1964 came after years of political consolidation. After coming to power in the Free Officers revolution in 1952, president Gamal Abdel Nasser spent the first decade of his rule balancing the most dangerous institutional challengers to his regime. In 1952, Nasser undertook massive land reforms that redistributed land to the landless and increased the country's agricultural production. More importantly for the internal politics of his regime, though, the land reforms were designed "to break any political opposition to the revolution from the *ancien régime*'s *pasha* class" [@Bush:2002, 9]. The reforms granted the state the authority to seize land from the former political ruling class and were thus instrumental in balancing out the risk they posed to Nasser's rule. In addition to neutralizing the economic ruling class, Nasser limited opposition from political and religious elites by banning all political parties in 1953 and suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood in 1954, blacklisting former politicians and arresting tens of thousands of Islamists [@Jankowski:2002, 20–23]. These swift and dramatic moves against potential institutional challengers allowed Nasser to consolidate his party's rule and remain in power for nearly two decades.

Having coopted and neutralized key political actors, Nasser turned to other institutional actors that posed less of an immediate threat. In 1964, after more than a decade in office, Nasser helped pass the Law 32 of 1964, or the Civic Association Code—the first piece of legislation related to NGOs in the Middle East. This new law followed Nasser's pattern of subsuming political institutions into the government. NGOs required government approval to be established, and officials were given unlimited discretion and authority to grant or deny registration status. Additionally, officials could dissolve or merge registered NGOs and could replace their boards of directors [@icnl-egypt:2010, 2–3; @Agati:2007]. 

Law 32 of 1964 established a pattern for all future NGO regulations in Egypt. The law gave the government incredible control over Egypt's nascent civil society, but it was rarely followed to the letter. Law 32 served as a marker of the regime's ideal level of NGO activity—the ideal point in the model of amicable contempt—but the regime used discretion to expand or constrict the allowable space around that ideal point. Accordingly, Egyptian civil society organizations found ways to work within that allowable space and adapted to the new regulations. In the early 1980s, NGOs dealing with contentious issues like human rights and women's empowerment avoided the jurisdiction of Law 32 by registering as "civil societies," which were governed by the country's civil code, rather than associations, which fell under the purview of the Ministry of Social Affairs [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 105]. Some NGOs were thus able to take advantage of the law's discretion and selected their own regulatory body (though, as I explore in more detail in Chapter 6, such a strategy is only possible when NGOs enjoy large levels of instrumental flexibility). 

Motivated primarily by concerns of domestic stability and internal regime cohesion, the Egyptian government therefore formalized loopholes and discretionary authority into the law—the regime allowed for a degree of institutional dissonance from NGOs and civil society, but reserved the right to step in and stop unwanted activities at its discretion. 

### Civil society and internal threats to stability under Mubarak

Under Nasser, civil society entered into the regime's stability-seeking calculus only after more salient actors had been balanced and controlled. Regulating civil society was put off until the regime had consolidated power. This pattern continued after Nasser's death in 1970. His successor, Anwar Sadat, did little to regulate civil society during his presidency. Sadat reversed many of Nasser's policies, diplomatically aligning Egypt with the United States, signing a peace treaty with neighboring Israel, and launching a wave of neoliberal economic reforms known as the *infitaḥ,* or "opening." Driven by structural adjustment programs sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the *infitaḥ* opened the country to international trade and created new capitalist industries, dramatically reshaping the Egyptian economy.

After Sadat's assassination in 1981, newly-appointed president Ḥosni Mubarak spent the first decade of his rule once again consolidating the regime's power and balancing out potential challengers. While Nasser had marginalized the old economic and political classes, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak faced a radically different institutional landscape, thanks to Sadat's neoliberal economic reforms. Fueled by economic expansion in the 1980s and early 1990s, labor unions and a growing capitalist class posed a possible threat to Mubarak's new regime, especially since capital and labor have historically tended to be "the agents of democratization, not the allies of authoritarianism" [@Bellin:2002, 2]. To prevent these new economic classes from obtaining too much power, Mubarak structured economic reforms in ways that linked both labor and capital to his regime, supporting and co-opting labor unions, sponsoring industrial development projects, and incorporating capitalists into his cabinet and inner circle. As a result, the government stunted these actors' possible commitment to democratization and neutralized their risk. Throughout this consolidation of labor and capital during the 1980s and 90s, Mubarak paid little attention to domestic or international civil society—it was not a priority. This changed in the mid-1990s when, following the predictions of the statistical model, escalating domestic instability at home and increasing internal regime consolidation to set the stage for the first statutory constriction of civil society since 1964. 

Between 1992–1997, militant Islamist groups carried out dozens of attacks throughout the country, killing more than 1,000 Egyptian civilians during a five-year insurgency. The offensive gripped the Egyptian media as the insurgents undertook high profile attacks, including an assassination attempt on Mubarak during a state visit to Ethiopia in 1995. At the height of the insurgency in November 1997, members of al-Gamaʿa al-Islamiyya gunned down 70 people—including 60 foreign tourists—in front of the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor [@Wright:2007, 243, 290–93]. Following the Luxor massacre, the government responded by limiting institutional dissonance across the board. In particular, because insurgent groups had been receiving funds from abroad, any institution connected with foreign countries became suspect—including domestic NGOs funded by foreign grants and international NGOs run by foreign employees. In 1998, state-run newspapers and television launched a media campaign linking foreign funding of NGOs to "dubious activities, corruption, profiteering" and labelled foreign-backed NGOs as threats to national security [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 113].

After stoking popular resentment against NGOs, Mubarak worked with the lower house of parliament to draft and pass new legislation to replace Law 32 of 1964. The subsequent Law 153 of 1999 allowed the regime to bring human rights NGOs under the umbrella of the state, ostensibly closing off the loophole they had previously relied on to avoid the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The passage of this law shifted the regime's ideal point to the left, institutionalizing its reduced preferences for civil society activity. Accordingly, following the model, the size of the overlap in preferences—or the practical operating environment—shrunk. The provisions of the new law eliminated some of the "margin of free movement" that NGOs had previously enjoyed [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 120], gave the government jurisdiction over any organization "whose objectives or activities were similar to those of NGOs, even if it assumed a legal form that was different from that of NGOs and institutions," and forced hundreds of organizations to re-register [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 118].

However, in a move that frustrated this attempt to gain more control over civil society, the Egyptian Constitutional Court ruled Law 153 of 1999 unconstitutional the following year, declaring that it had been passed without consulting the country's upper house of parliament and that its provisions limiting civic space violated constitutional protections guaranteeing freedom of association. Reeling from this setback, the regime quietly tweaked the rejected law and passed it through both houses of parliament without public fanfare, resulting in Law 84 of 2002, or the Law on Associations and Foundations [@Agati:2007, 60]. In addition to requiring that all NGOs register with the Ministry of Social Solidarity, the new law imposed specific limits on international and foreign-connected NGOs. Any revenue from foreign associations to nonprofit organizations working in Egypt required both recipients and donors to submit multiple applications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and state security, and the latter maintained ultimate veto power over the approval process [@Thabet:2004, 162]. 

In response to domestic crises and a spike in terrorism, the Mubarak regime formally redefined its ideal point. But, as seen in @fig:timeline-egy, the de facto CSRE remained constant after 2002. Though it granted the government substantial oversight power over NGOs, Law 84 also allowed for enormous discretion in enforcement. According to an Egyptian academic cited in a 2010 US embassy cable, the vast majority of Egyptian NGOs adhered to Law 84 obligations and registered with the Ministry of Social Solidarity. NGOs that did not register generally worked on contentious human rights-related issues [@10CAIRO217a], or had foreign connections. Though contentious foreign-sponsored and international NGOs were more likely to resist attempts at registering, many were able to navigate legal loopholes that Law 84 was supposed to have closed. Some NGOs registered as nonprofit "civil companies" rather than advocacy organizations, thus avoiding oversight from the Ministry of Social Affairs [@10CAIRO217a]. In 2007, there were rumors that the government was considering closing this civil companies loophole [@07CAIRO2067a], but such reforms never materialized and organizations continued to creatively maneuver the legal environment. 

While it might appear that Law 84's discretionary provisions gave NGOs substantial latitude, discretion cut both ways. Allowing NGOs to register under different ministries encourages registration, which in turn links organizations more directly to the government and creates a patron-client relationship, thus improving the government's chances of capturing NGO resources. One observer described the impact of this Law 84-enabled patronage, explaining:

> The government takes control by division and segregation and affiliates them [NGOs] to a different minister. Everyone in civil society has a godfather. Even if they're useful, they're corrupt. … Even the Boy Scout movement was completely destroyed [@Sissions:2005, 5].

Additionally, if an organization becomes too contentious and poses a threat to the regime, officials can use minor infractions in more obscure parts of the law to fine or shut down the NGO. For instance, the stated legal pretext for the December 2011 raids on INGOs was that the organizations were not officially registered and thus in violation of Law 84. However, as I will show in Chapter 6, each of the organizations had registration packets pending with the relevant ministries. The International Republican Institute, in particular, first applied for formal registration status in 2006 and was told that they could work in the country as long as the application was in process.[^1] When facing increased domestic instability, though, ministry officials revoked this discretion and expelled the organization.

### Civil society and internal threats to stability after 2011

Maintaining institutional balance is essential for autocrats to remain in power. In their early years, Nasser and Mubarak both focused their attention on coopting and neutralizing more powerful political actors, including politicians, parliament, the judicial system, Islamist movements, capitalists, and labor unions. After consolidating their power, both presidents turned to the management of civil society, which posed less of a threat to the regime and thus was a lower priority. Mubarak's Minister of Social Solidarity explained as much in a conversation with the US ambassador to Egypt in 2007, noting that the government was considering revisions to Law 84, but that the issue was "'not urgent' like the revisions to the election law or the new anti-terror law" [@07CAIRO2200a]. 

Following the 2011 uprising, however, the importance of civil society as an institution—in particular foreign-connected and international NGOs—would reverse and take center stage as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), Morsi, and Sisi sought to consolidate power and regain regime cohesion and stability. The statistical model predicts that domestic unrest leads to crackdowns on domestic and international NGOs, while newer, less cohesive regimes are more likely to allow for more institutional dissonance and expand the allowable space for civil society action. Both of these countervailing forces have played a crucial role in post-revolutionary Egypt and help explain the closure of civic space in the country. 

In the immediate aftermath of Mubarak's ouster in February 2011, civic space in Egypt saw an unprecedented opening and expansion under the rule of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. As seen in @fig:timeline-egy, the CSRE jumped from −1.7 in 2010 to −0.6 at the end of 2012, the highest in the country's history. Law 84 continued to govern state–civil society relations, but SCAF's arbitrary enforcement of the law decreased substantially. Following the model, SCAF's lack of internal cohesion and its short time in office contributed to its openness to civil society. Evidence bears this out, as the military made public concessions to international NGOs and local human rights activists in an effort to demonstrate its commitment to reform and democratization. Domestic human rights NGOs and activist bloggers that had been involved in the revolution continued their political advocacy and spoke up against SCAF abuses and crackdowns. Citizens formed *ligān shaʿbiya*—informal popular committees and unregistered NGOs—that engaged in contentious community advocacy, mobilizing voters for constitutional referenda and parliamentary elections, demanding improved social services for their neighborhoods, and exposing corrupt local officials and police who had violated human rights [@El-Meehy:2016].

International human rights NGOs played a growing role as well: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch (HRW), IRI, NDI, and other organizations that had previously been banned or heavily restricted were invited to return. IRI and NDI consulted with electoral committees to prepare for a slew of upcoming elections. Amnesty and HRW held direct meetings with military officials and confronted them with reports of human rights abuses. In June 2011, for instance, a delegation from HRW  met with military officers and interim politicians to call on SCAF to pursue legal action against former Mubarak-era officials, end its widespread use of military trials for civilians, and investigate allegations of torture and virginity tests used against protesters [@hrw:2011a].[^2] That same month, Amnesty staff in Cairo met with General ʿAbd al-Fattaḥ al-Sīsī (then a member of SCAF) about the charges of virginity testing. As a result of the meeting, Sisi committed to ending the practice of testing women and promised to avoid detaining women in the future. The general also urged Egyptians to hold the military accountable, saying that "people alleging human rights abuses at the hands of the army should complain to the military prosecutor, and can also post their complaints on the SCAF Facebook page" [@amnesty:2011]. This apparent openness to popular criticism was a small concession to domestic and international watchdog NGOs, but it was mostly symbolic—in 2011 there were 4.7 million Egyptian Facebook users [@SalemMourtada:2011, 4]—representing only 6% of the country's population—and SCAF heavily moderated its page and regularly deleted comments.[^3] 

Amid this apparent expansion of civic space and the growing involvement of international civil society in Egyptian politics, at the end of 2011, domestic tensions and instability reversed the trend, fitting once again with the model's predictions. In the interest of consolidating its power, SCAF worked throughout the year to curtail protests and often resorted to violence to break up demonstrations, including the massacre of 28 protesters at the state media headquarters in October.[^4] For most of 2011, SCAF's crackdown was aimed at individual protesters, not at civil society organizations themselves. This changed in December, though, when Egyptian security forces raided the offices of 17 local and international NGOs [@FadelWarrick:2011]—including Freedom House, NDI, and IRI—and arrested dozens of domestic and international NGO employees. The domestic unrest that had led to the October massacre continued to foment during the parliamentary elections, and protesters in turn continued to demonstrate in downtown Cairo. The tension culminated on December 16, when military troops filled Tahrir Square to put down an anti-SCAF demonstration. The breakup led to three days of intense clashes between the military and protesters, with 10 civilians dead and 441 wounded.[^5] The military's coordinated raids on INGO offices came two weeks later.

The interplay between regime consolidation and domestic stability explain SCAF's sudden closure of civic space and crackdown on international civil society. Prior to the parliamentary elections, SCAF had been careful to allow for popular protests and court INGOs like Amnesty and IRI. Showing deference to these actors helped with the caretaker regime's institutional balancing and allowed SCAF to show that it was responsive to its citizens—an important strategy, given that the previous regime had just been overthrown because of popular unrest and anger over Mubarak's repressive government. As domestic stability worsened during 2011, SCAF maintained a fairly open and courteous relationship with INGOs and local civil society until parliamentary elections began. In the first two rounds of elections, politicians friendly to SCAF won—a sign that the regime's internal cohesion was strengthening, that "the Egyptian public [was] on its side," [@ap-egypt-protests:2011] and that SCAF was mastering the institutional balance. 

Egypt held its first post-revolutionary elections in June 2012, and Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, won the presidency. The military—which had cemented itself as a central and popular player in Egyptian politics—moved to the background but watched Morsi's rule from the sidelines, ready to intervene when their interests were threatened [@Cook:2007]. Morsi's short presidency was marked with internal domestic chaos and rapidly collapsing regime cohesion. Following the statistical model, Morsi should have held off from regulating civil society in his early years, focusing instead on neutralizing other political challengers like the parliament, courts, and military. However, the unrest that SCAF had faced in 2011–2012 continued unabated—the military was reluctant to hand off the reigns of government and dissolved the newly elected parliament; protesters still occupied Tahrir Square; and a growing insurgency in the Sinai had killed dozens of police and soldiers. This overwhelming instability led Morsi to attempt to challenge and balance out smaller institutional actors like domestic and international civil society. 

In December 2012, Morsi announced new draft legislation that would nationalize all civil society organizations and fold them into the Ministry of Social Affairs—NGO staff would be considered civil servants and would fall under complete control of the government [@ngo-law:2012]. The proposal was temporarily tabled following strong backlash from dozens of human and civil rights groups, but it reappeared in February 2013 when the Ministry submitted a final draft of the law to parliament with additional restrictions—prohibiting NGOs from participating in political activities, requiring the retroactive registration of 40,000 organizations, and creating additional bureaucratic hurdles to receive approval for most aid projects [@Halawa:2013; @cihrs:2013]. In a display of its commitment to restrict civil society, the Morsi's regime completed the public prosecution of Case 173 of 2011—the trial against the 43 NGO and INGO workers arrested during the December 2011 raids. In June 2013, the court sentenced the defendants (both Egyptian and foreign) to 1–5-year prison terms for violating Law 84 and a handful of articles in the country's penal code.

Despite this public show of force against international civil society, Morsi ran out of time to push his draft legislation through parliament.[^6] Morsi ultimately was unable to successfully balance rival institutions, and in the summer of 2013, the military reasserted its power. During the last two weeks of June, military leaders conducted more than forty attacks on Muslim Brotherhood offices and party headquarters, putting immense destabilizing pressure on Morsi's regime in Cairo [@Ketchley:2017]. These attacks were followed by a mass popular protest—on June 30, hundreds of thousands of protesters flocked to Tahrir Square to demand the president's resignation. However, this popular anti-Morsi movement, named Tamarod ("rebellion") was not spontaneous or autonomous—recent research has found that this rebellion against Morsi's regime was manufactured by the military, who secretly funneled money and directions to Tamarod's leaders [@Ketchley:2017]. Following Morsi's resignation on July 3, the military arrested him and dozens of members of his administration and rounded up party officials around the country. Morsi's treatment of civil society went contrary to what the statistical model predicts. However, the circumstances of Morsi's brief presidential rule seem to prove the exception to the model and explain the divergence in the country's actual CSRE and the model's predicted CSRE. Previous regimes made concessions to civil society early in their terms, and then later withdrew their support and imposed stricter laws to formalize their preferences regarding their relationship to civil society. In the face of a deep domestic political crisis, though, Morsi moved against civil society—and all other political institutions—much more quickly. In the end, he was unable to balance out any institutional challenger—including civil society—and his regime ended.

In July 2013, under the command of General Sisi, the military installed Adly Mansour, the Chief Justice of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, as the temporary president. Mansour in turn appointed Sisi as his Minister of Defense, and in June 2014, Sisi won the first post-coup presidential election. As defense minister and as president Sisi intensified Morsi's attack on domestic and international civil society. This expanded crackdown again goes against the model's predictions—civil society restrictions should come after a regime has been in power for a while. But Sisi was not new to Egyptian politics. Under his direction, the military had ruled behind the scenes since February 2011, and he himself was a top minister during SCAF's rule. As with the military's crackdown on international NGOs at the end of 2011, Adly and Sisi enjoyed immense popular support for their coup against Morsi and could thus afford to not make concessions to civil society organizations. 

Additionally, growing domestic unrest provided additional pretext for expanding the crackdown. Insurgent attacks in the Sinai intensified and dozens of soldiers were killed. More importantly, though, the new regime faced growing opposition from the now-disenfranchised Muslim Brotherhood. Members of the Brotherhood held regular protests for weeks after the July 2013 coup, questioning the authority of the transition government and calling for early presidential elections. Between July and August 2013, military and police forces killed more than 1,150 demonstrators, and wounded and arrested thousands more. In the most egregious case, on August 14, military personnel used armored personnel carriers, bulldozers, snipers, and infantry in a raid on a Brotherhood encampment in Rābʿa Square in Eastern Cairo, killing between 800–1,000 protesters in a single day [@hrw:2014]. 

The regime's cohesion and a domestic political crisis that was rapidly spiraling out of control provided the conditions for a constriction of the civil society regulatory environment, and—in accordance with the model—Sisi quickly moved against domestic and international human rights organizations. In July 2014, a month after taking office, Sisi resurrected Morsi's draft NGO legislation and added additional provisions to give the government and security agencies the authority to dissolve existing NGOs if their activities threatened national unity or posed a threat to national security [@hrw:2014a]. The draft also included strong prohibitions and limitations on foreign funding, restricting international NGOs from paying for their in-country operations or from providing grants to local NGOs. While the Ministry of Social Solidarity worked on refining the draft, Sisi constricted the CSRE by wielding the discretionary authority of Law 84. In 2015 alone, the government shut down more than 500 NGOs, charging the organizations with violations of Law 84, the penal code, terrorism and national security laws, and a new anti-protest law, Law 107 of 2013 [@madamasr:2015]—prosecutors "threw the book" at NGOs it identified as threats.[^7] International NGOs were not immune from the crackdown. In June 2015, Sisi reopened Case 173 of 2011 to expand the charges that had previously been filed against IRI, NDI, and Human Rights Watch.[^8] The directors and staff of dozens of prominent Cairo-based human rights NGO and INGOs have had their assets frozen, have been banned from traveling, or have been arrested since the expansion of Case 173.[^9] Having already consolidated his regime's power, and spurred on by domestic crises, Sisi thus moved against civil society early in his reign and has continued to keep the institution neutralized.

Finally, on May 29, 2017—after years of languishing in draft form—President Sisi signed Law 70 of 2017 on Associations and Other Foundations Working in the Field of Civil Work [@icnl-egypt]. The new law represented a crystallization of Sisi's preference for reduced civil society advocacy, shifting the government's theoretical ideal point further to the left (in the model). Though Law 70 does not completely subsume civil society into a government ministry, as Morsi had originally proposed in 2012, it includes a host of statutory restrictions and penalties, including jail sentences of up to five years and fines reaching one million EGP (≈$55,000). Notably, the law heavily regulates international civil society. Registration fees for foreign NGOs are exceptionally high, and local NGOs—a common recipient of INGO funds—are prohibited from accepting foreign funding without approval from the National Agency to Regulate the Work of Foreign NGOs. This new government agency has 60 days to approve the transfer of funds from abroad, and a lack of a response is considered a rejection—a reversal from Law 84's provision that a non-response constituted approval. Domestic NGOs must also obtain permission from the Ministry of Social Solidarity before they "cooperate with, join, affiliate with, or participate with" any foreign organization, experts, employees, or volunteers. Additionally, domestic NGOs cannot circumvent these laws by becoming INGOs—organizations cannot open branches outside of the country without Ministry approval.  It remains to be seen how restrictive Law 70 will be in practice. The law allows officials to close any NGO that "may harm national security, law and order, public morals, or public health," [@icnl-egypt] giving the government significant interpretive discretion.

## Regional threats

The development of INGO-related legislation in Egypt has been driven primarily by internal concerns over regime cohesion and domestic unrest. Civil society—including both domestic and international NGOs—has played a role in each regime's stability-seeking calculus, and internal stability (or the lack thereof) shaped the establishment of formal NGO laws and determined the level of de facto discretion used in enforcing those laws. Regional politics have also played an important—albeit less prominent—role in the development of the legal regime for civil society. Contrary to my original hypothesis, the statistical model predicts that the CSRE has a negative relationship with regional political stability—when a country's neighborhood experiences more unrest, coups, and nonviolent protests, it is more likely to make concessions to civil society and expand the regulatory environment for NGOs. 

@fig:timeline-egy shows two decreases in Egypt's neighborhood stability: a slight drop in the late 1990s–early 2000s, followed by a dramatic drop in 2011. Each of these periods of regional instability influenced how Egypt regulated international and domestic civil society. As discussed previously, the major impetus for Mubarak's passage of Law 153 of 1999 and Law 84 of 2002 was the Islamist insurgency raging throughout the country. The passage of new legislation gave Mubarak the ability to better control civil society in the name of national security, helping mitigate and balance out the Islamist threat. Events in neighboring Palestine, however, also shaped the design and implementation of Law 84.

In September 2000, in response to Israeli Prime Minister Arial Sharon's unexpected visit to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, Palestinians began the Second Intifada—or popular uprising—against Israeli occupation. Egyptians had long been sympathetic to Palestinians, but the methods used by the Palestinian resistance during the Intifada worried the government. In the wake of the Islamist insurgency that ended in 1997, Mubarak promised a controlled form of democratization, of which Law 84 was a part. As long as terrorism was contained and warded off, the government would pass laws that appeared to expand civil liberties. "Excessive democracy" could potentially empower terrorists and insurgents, and accordingly, when domestic threats arose, the margin for freedom constricted [@Agati:2007, 61–62]. 

As the Intifada raged on, though, Palestinians carried out suicide bombings and other attacks reminiscent of Egypt's own 1992–97 insurgency. Human rights NGOs in Cairo that supported Palestine thus posed a dilemma—by permitting popular protests in support of the Intifada and allowing NGOs to advocate for Palestinian issues tacitly, the government feared unintentionally endorsing tactics that Islamist insurgents had recently used in Egypt. In 2000, thousands of students organized the Egyptian Popular Committee for the Support of the Palestinian Intifada (EPCSPI), which led boycott campaigns against Israel and the United States, collected donations to send to Palestine, and held dozens of street protests [@El-Mahdi:2009, 93; @Shehata:2012]. The success of the EPCSPI led to the creation of other similar committees in 2003 in response to the US invasion of Iraq, and some have argued that these early student movements helped set the stage for the mass uprising in 2011 [@Shehata:2012]. 

Law 84 of 2002 helped Mubarak to thread a difficult needle. The student-led popular committees fit well with Mubarak's agenda of controlled democratization, but supporting them could potentially lead to an increase in domestic terrorism. Law 84 was a useful lever for controlling the allowable margin of democratization and dissonance—its built-in discretionary authority permitted officials to crack down on civil society as needed. The passage of Law 84 amid unrest in Palestine goes against the prediction of the model. More unrest abroad should, in theory, be associated with more concessions to civil society at home, but Law 84 ostensibly gave the government more power to regulate and restrict civil society. Although the regime  reduced its preference for civil society advocacy by shifting its ideal point to the left in @fig:theory-regime-dot, the practical effect of this new law on the CSRE was minimal because of the law's incredible discretionary authority. The CSRE remained stable throughout the 1990s and 2000s, despite the threat of Intifada and the passage of Law 84. The discretion inherent in Law 84 permitted the government to give the *appearance* of concessions to civil society, enabling organizations like EPCSPI to operate while simultaneously providing the government with the ability to target individual NGOs.

In contrast, the more dramatic period of regional instability in 2011 follows the model's prediction that neighborhood unrest is associated with expanded civil society at home. In the immediate aftermath of the 2011 uprising, this was indeed the case—domestic instability and the CSRE index are clearly negatively correlated in @fig:timeline-egy, with each trend line diverging sharply from the other. However, the chain of events does not provide enough evidence to identify regional unrest as the cause of the expansion of the CSRE. 

The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt happened in rapid succession—Tunisia's Ben ʿAli resigned on January 14, 2011, and the protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square began 11 days later on the 25th. It is likely that the Tunisian protests spread to Egypt in a sort of revolutionary prairie fire [@Kuran:1989], occurring too rapidly for Mubarak to even consider making concessions to civil society. The statistical correlation between the CSRE and neighborhood instability might have occurred *after* Mubarak's resignation, but as explored in detail above, SCAF and Morsi were overwhelmingly concerned with domestic stability and regime cohesion. Unrest in Tunisia, Libya, Bahrain, and elsewhere in 2011 was thus unlikely to further destabilize the country—it had already been affected by the regional unrest and its new leaders were dealing with the consequences. Had Mubarak not left office in 2011 and a similar sudden rise in the CSRE occurred in the following year, the story that making concessions to civil society to protect against regional instability would be more convincing. As it stands now, though, regional instability and the CSRE are only correlated in 2011—there is most likely not a causal relationship. 

Thus, regional instability is clearly linked with changes in Egypt's CSRE, but for varying reasons. The second Palestinian Intifada helped encourage the passage of Law 84, which created vast discretionary authority that allowed Mubarak to carefully balance the popular desire to support Palestine against the threat of supporting domestic terror groups. The 2011 uprising preceded Egypt's largest ever improvement in the CSRE, but the connection is better explained with internal domestic politics. 

## Reputational concerns

Finally, reputational concerns appear to have played a minimal role in shaping either Egypt's formal INGO-related legislation or its de facto civil society regulatory environment. @fig:timeline-egy demonstrates this—the country faced low levels of international shaming in the press until 2012–13, when Morsi's crackdown on protesters, the anti-Morsi coup, and the military's massacre of Muslim Brotherhood members drew international ire and condemnation. The drop in the CSRE correlates temporally with the increase in shaming, but when the shaming subsided following Morsi's abdication and Sisi's eventual rise to power, the CSRE did not rebound in turn. 

It is possible that preemptive shaming and unobservable diplomacy could have an effect on INGO regulations, but it is difficult to find evidence to support this. Wikileaks cables offer a glimpse into Egypt's reputational concerns. In August 2006, a delegation from the United States met with Egyptian government officials in a series of wide-ranging topics related to US foreign aid. During the meeting, the Egyptian Minister of Social Solidarity defended Law 84 and argued that the Egyptian government needed the law's powers to maintain a safe and healthy civil society regulatory environment. Distressed by the treatment of domestic and international NGOs in Egypt under Law 84 (and concerned with USAID's ability to partner with those NGOs when undertaking development projects), the National Security Council (NSC) Director for Democracy and Human Rights responded by requesting that the US be allowed to provide comments on the law, with the goal of "revising NGO legislation to bring it into compliance with international standards" [@06CAIRO5019a]. The US wielded its diplomatic power to attempt to influence NGO law reforms with an oblique reference to international reputation (i.e. appealing to the notion of compliance with international standards). However, no reforms ever took place under Mubarak, and NGO-related statutes did not receive any statutory updates until 2017. International reputation thus likely played little role in Egypt's NGO regulations.

# Russia

The case of Russia demonstrates how reactions to external threats can fuel a regime's decision to expand or constrict the civil society regulatory environment. Post-Soviet Russia was a proving ground for an emerging global civil society, and as thousands of Western funded NGOs began operations in the 1990s, tensions between domestic state sovereignty, foreign states, and international non-state actors boiled up. This led to a series of laws strategically tailored to curb international influence in Russia's domestic affairs, as part of Vladimir Putin's agenda of pursuing "sovereign globalization"—working with the international community on the country's own terms. In this case study, I trace the development of Russia's regulatory environment for international and foreign-based NGOs since 1990, comparing key legislative restrictions with the statistical model's predictions of how internal, external, and reputational factors determine regulations. @fig:timeline-rus provides an overview of each of these factors.

![Timeline of de jure and de facto NGO regulations in Russia](../../Output/figures/2-timeline-rus){#fig:timeline-rus}

## Internal risk

Elected as Russia's first post-Soviet president, Boris Yeltsin faced significant political instability in the early years of his presidency. Yeltsin struggled to consolidate his power and balance out other challengers, and in the final months of 1994, regime cohesion dropped to one of its lowest points (see @fig:timeline-rus), following months of high inflation rates, IMF-backed economic shock therapy, intra-regime conflict, and persistent constitutional crises. Most threatening to the regime's stability, however, was the direct threat of the Chechnya separatist movement, which had fomented since 1992. Yeltsin ordered an invasion of Chechnya in December 1994, launching a two-year civil war that would eventually end in stalemate. 

Amid this domestic unrest and his struggle to contain divisions within his regime, Yeltsin faced another growing challenge to his regime. Global civil society gained significant prominence in global affairs [@Lipschutz:1992], and particularly so in newly democratizing Eastern Europe and Latin America [@Munck:2010]. Foreign foundations and private donors interested in democratization flooded Russia's nascent grassroots society organizations with aid in the early and mid-1990s, which provided hundreds of civil society organizations with valuable equipment and training and substantially increased their organizational capacity. This influx of foreign funds, however, changed the nature of existing Russian NGOs and forged patron-client ties between international donors and Russian recipients, strengthening vertical ties between NGOs and foreign nations, rather than creating horizontal networks necessary for a more robust and socially responsive civil society sector. Instead of a strong grassroots civil society, foreign democratization aid in post-Soviet Russia helped created a "professionalized realm of NGOs, inaccessible to most local groups and compromised by its links to a neoliberal vision of development" [@Hemment:2004, 215].

In the first years of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, the Russian legal system was ill-equipped to handle this rush of foreign-backed grassroots civil society [@Henderson:2003]. The 1977 Soviet constitution contained provisions for creating social organizations to encourage education, sport, and culture, and the Communist party controlled and oversaw all state-approved organizations [@Albertie:2004]. With the collapse of the party and *ancien régime,* however, the new post-Soviet NGO sector was governed by outmoded laws that both stifled activists and prevented the government from controlling the sector. 

In the midst of this tumultuous political milieu, the two internal mechanisms of the statistical model conflicted. The model predicts that civic space should constrict in response to domestic unrest, and should expand when rulers do not have strong regime cohesion, as dictators make concessions to civil society organizations in an effort to maintain institutional balance. In 1995, Yeltsin faced high levels of domestic instability *and* had incredibly low levels of regime cohesion. Confronting this dilemma, the president imposed new restrictions on civil society, showing that fears of domestic unrest override concerns over internal regime consolidation. The Russian Duma passed the 1995 Law on Public Associations, providing a legal foundation for regulating civil society in modern Russia. The law delineated the relationship between the government and NGOs and outlined bureaucratic procedures for establishing and maintaining NGOs [@Albertie:2004]. Importantly, though the 1995 law was not specifically targeted at international NGOs, the new regulations allowed the government to regain control over Russian domestic civil society and limit foreign influence. The law forced the registration or re-registration of all domestic and international NGOs by 1999, and failing to register led to liquidation and closure. On its face, reregistration was intended to update administrative information and improve government efficiency, but "in effect, the re-registration provision operated to eliminate troublesome and undesirable organizations" [@Albertie:2004, 20], and in particular organizations funded by foreign sponsors that dealt with human rights issues.

![Effect of 1999 registration requirement](../../Output/figures/russia_reregistration_before_after){#fig:russia-reregistration-before-after}

Reregistration proved to be a difficult hurdle for many organizations. Government bureaucrats wielded discretionary power in deciding which NGOs would be allowed to register, and NGOs were denied official recognition because of arbitrary issues, such as submitting applications with too many pages or an incorrect font size [@Albertie:2004, 22]. Ultimately, the 1995 law dramatically reduced the size of Russian civil society, as seen in @fig:russia-reregistration-before-after [@Grishina:2000]. Thousands of public associations throughout the country—many flush with foreign funds—shuttered their doors and ceased their work. As seen in @fig:timeline-rus, the 1999 registration deadline marked the start of the steady decline in Russia's civil society regulatory environment. 

Following his inauguration in 2000, Vladimir Putin rapidly consolidated his power and took direct control over the country's political institutions. In 2002, he ended elections for regional governors and gave himself the power to directly appoint regional bureaucrats, and thereby indirectly appoint their local legislative and judicial subordinates. Putin also took control of the country's last independent television network, threatened journalists (and allegedly assassinated the most vocal), and cajoled the country's oligarchs into cooperating with the regime [@Blitt:2008]. Putin's neutralization of potential challengers followed the autocratic pattern of institutional balancing, and he moved quickly against the institutions that posed the greatest threat to the cohesion of his regime. In Egypt, Nasser and Mubarak had passed formal legislation targeting NGOs (in 1964 and 2002, respectively) after consolidating their power and attaining high regime cohesion. Putin did the same, passing Federal Law No. 18-FZ in 2006 at the height of his political consolidation. The new law imposed dozens of additional registration requirements for NGOs and granted government bureaucrats additional discretionary powers to permit or deny legal status to applicants. While Putin's internal regime cohesion paved the way for stricter civil society restrictions, the 2006 NGO law in Russia is best explained by fears of external threats, which I explore in the next section.

In 2008, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev succeeded Putin as president, and inherited the former ruler's formidable consolidated political scene. However, Medvedev struggled to maintain that cohesion and work with the constellation of politicians, oligarchs, and bureaucrats that were loyal to Putin. Accordingly, the regime's stability dropped steadily during his time in office (see @fig:timeline-rus). To offset this decline, Medvedev attempted to expand the space for civil society, consistent with the predictions of the model. In November 2008, he offered NGOs an olive branch in his inauguration speech, calling for closer and more amiable cooperation between the government and civil society sector [@Flikke:2015, 5]. Medvedev met with NGO leaders in 2009 and promised to review the 2006 NGO law, ultimately passing several amendments to ease some of the strictest regulations, in particular not allowing bureaucrats to deny registration to organizations that threatened Russia's cultural heritage or national interests [@Jenkins:2012, 506–7]. This newfound openness did not last long. In 2010, unable to extract the necessary concessions from civil society and unable to stem the decline in his regime's cohesion, Medvedev increased discretionary and targeted restrictions on international and western-backed NGOs. By 2012, the CSRE declined to its lowest level in Russian history, setting the stage for a new formalization of state–NGO relations.

## External threats

While Mubarak's Law 84 of 2002 was driven primarily by increasing domestic tensions—most notably the Islamist insurgency of the 1990s and the regime's subsequent fear of the spread of terrorism—the 2006 NGO law in Russia is best explained as a means of containing revolutionary contagion and foreign influence from neighboring countries. The government passed the law following three prominent Eastern European political revolutions—the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, the 2004–2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan. In these Color Revolutions, thousands of protesters took to the streets in mass demonstrations that eventually led to the overthrow of each ruling regime. Both international NGOs and Western-supported domestic NGOs played a critical role in each revolution. As in Russia, backed by millions of dollars in democracy assistance aid, global civil society had established itself as a powerful institution in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, but unlike Russia, none of these states had curbed the influence of the sector to the same extent. Subsequently, Western NGOs and civil society groups provided material support to aggrieved protesters and helped shape post-revolutionary governments [@Tudoroiu:2007].

Given their role in the Color Revolutions, Putin and his administration were concerned with the potential destabilizing influence of international NGOs, and the 2006 law appears to have been drafted explicitly to prevent and stave off revolutionary contagion from the region [@Machleder:2006]. Developments after the 2006 law provide some evidence for Russian fears of contagion. In an effort to realign domestic NGOs with Russia, rather than Western foundations and INGOs, Putin attempted to make the state the "primary financier" of the NGO sector [@CrottyHallLjubownikow:2014], thus heading off potential external influence. The government established the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, a bureaucratic body responsible for doling out all federal funding to NGOs through competitive grants [@Richter:2009]. In theory, the Chamber would have allowed the state to sever the financial ties between NGOs and Western organizations, but ultimately, the Chamber has been wildly inefficient—in 2010, the Chamber awarded one billion rubles to 604 of Russia's 300,000 NGOs [@LjubownikowCrotty:2014, 766], and it has been widely criticized for its corruption [@Richter:2009].

Bureaucrats were empowered to deny registration to any international NGO if its "goals and objectives … create[d] a threat to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, national unity, unique character, cultural heritage, and national interests of the Russian Federation" [@icnl-russia:2006, 2]. Additionally, the government gained new supervisory powers and required that domestic and international NGOs provide details of all foreign funds, allow bureaucrats to observe or participate in any public or private event or meeting held by the organization, and ultimately determine whether an NGO's programming is appropriate and nonthreatening. The law also imposed restriction on foreign nationals, preventing anyone not legally residing in Russia from being a founder, member, or participant in any NGO [@Maxwell:2006]. As with the 1995 law, miscellaneous minutia placed burdens on foreign NGOs and often led to the revocation of their legal status—for example, the new law required that all registration materials had to be translated into Russian and certified by the government, but officials would often reject these certified translations, claiming they were "repulsive" and done poorly, forcing INGOs to pay for multiple translations [@Blitt:2008, 36]. 

More importantly, though, throughout his presidency Putin was not so much concerned with *regional* instability (which, as seen in @fig:timeline-rus, has been incredibly stable since 1995), as he was with *global* stability. Putin recognized the political consequences of globalization early in his presidency, having seen firsthand the role Western governments and INGOs had played in the 1990s. Accordingly, Putin pursued an agenda aimed at integrating Russia into global economic institutions on its own terms. Early in his presidency, Putin recognized that globalization was inevitable and necessary for sustained economic growth. In his annual speech to the Federal Assembly in 2003, he noted that

> No country today, no matter how big and how wealthy, can develop successfully in isolation from the rest of the world. On the contrary, the biggest success comes to those countries that consciously use their energy and intelligence to integrate themselves into the world economy [@Gould-Davies:2016, 9; @Richter:2017].

Important in this statement is Putin's emphasis on "consciously" integrating into the world economy. Too little integration would not yield economic benefits, while too much integration could introduce uncontrollable political economic actors into his stability-seeking calculus [@Richter:2009a]. Putin resolved this dilemma by appealing to the Russian political notion of *gosudarstvennost*, or sovereignty—the idea that the state should "act as an internally coherent governing body" without outside intervention [@Squier:2002, 166]. This led to a strategy of "sovereign globalization," [@Gould-Davies:2016], where total state control over its political institutions would protect it against global forces that it necessarily had to confront. Putin summarized this idea clearly in 2015, declaring, "Either we remain sovereign, or we dissolve and lose ourselves in the world."[^10]

Maintaining *gosudarstvennost* was the primary motivation behind Putin's push to nationalize and extend control over the country's political, media, and business interests, as well as its attempts at controlling civil society and insulating it from the influence of international NGOs. Russia's 2006 NGO law was an early foray into the state's assertion of sovereignty over the affairs of INGOs working their country, and spurred on by a desire to expand that sovereignty, the regime further solidified its preferences for NGO activity with new anti-NGO laws in 2012 and 2015.

A few months following his second inauguration, Vladimir Putin signed the 2012 Foreign Agents Law, which contained a set of strict regulations aimed specifically at stigmatizing international NGOs and any domestic NGOs that received funds from abroad. Similar to the original 1995 Law on Associations, the 2012 law required that any NGO that either (1) received funding from or was based in a foreign country, or (2) engaged in any form of "political activity" (broadly defined) had to reregister with the government as an *inostranny agent* or "foreign agent," a legal term of art laden with powerful symbolic meaning—traitorous spies working against the Soviet regime during the Cold War received the same appellation.[^11] Beyond the registration requirement, the law also required that foreign-connected NGOs prominently advertise the fact that they were foreign agents on all publications, pamphlets, and marketing. Failing to disclose this status carried a fine of up to 500,000 rubles—roughly US $7,000 [@Flikke:2015, 9]. 

Since the law was implemented in 2012, Russian authorities have enforced it far more vigorously than previous NGO regulations, increasing spontaneous inspections and harassing and shuttering organizations that did not voluntarily register [@Flikke:2015, 10]. By 2015, a third of foreign-connected NGOs in Russia had shut down and left the country.[^12] Subsequent regulations passed in 2014 sought to co-opt international NGOs, as Putin restored and transformed the Public Chamber as the primary domestic source for NGO funding, thereby attempting to dissuade domestic organizations from linking with foreign powers. Most recently, the Duma passed a set of amendments to the 2012 law—the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law—which allowed the government to blacklist any foreign-connected NGO that it considered exceptionally undesirable. Prominent INGOs such as the Open Society Foundations (OSF), the MacArthur Foundation, Freedom House, Amnesty International, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) were all labeled as undesirable and subsequently expelled from the country.[^13]

As it had been in 2006, protecting *gosudarstvennost* against foreign meddling was the overriding factor driving the 2012 and 2015 laws, and the architects of the 2015 Undesirable Organizations law revealed as much. Konstantin Kosachev, the chair of the committee responsible for designating INGOs as undesirable, argued in 2015 that

> The scale of the foreign NGOs' activities in Russia is of a destructive nature and their aim is to overthrow the authorities in Russia. … Their main task is to try and make a direct impact on Russia's internal political processes, intervene in them and in the long run ensure that a regime that is more loyal to these states (that finance the NGOs in Russia) come[s] to power [@Hamlett:2015, 7].

One of the law's cosponsors, Aleksandr Tarnavsky, linked the harshness of the new INGO restrictions to notions of *gosudarstvennost*, arguing that the legislation would protect Russian from Western intervention. Noting that Ukraine had become overly enmeshed in Western interests, Tarnavsky explained that 

> Events in Ukraine have offended me, like many other Russians. Western countries audaciously spoke to us of friendship, while their secret services staged a coup hoping to tear Ukraine away from us. You act like that to us, then we’ll treat you the same. It's pure pragmatism—nothing personal.[^14]

Tarnavsky argued that the strict 2015 regulations would loom large for INGOs, like a "weapon hanging on the wall and that never fires,"[^15] forcing them to toe the government line and preventing them from disrupting Putin's balance of institutional actors. The 2015 law was thus conceived of as a type of defensive weapon to insulate Russian *gosudarstvennost* from undue foreign influence.

## Reputational concerns

Finally, like Egypt, interstate shaming of Russian actions appears to have little effect on the country's civil society regulatory environment. The country saw two spikes in international condemnation (see @fig:timeline-rus), but the negative coverage in the press was in response to Russian military operations, namely its 2008 invasion of Georgia and recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and its 2014 irredentist invasion and annexation of Crimea and its subsequent military occupation Eastern Ukraine. The CSRE did not change following either of these wars, and though the 2015 Undesirable Organizations was passed in the year after the annexation of Crimea, there is not an obvious connection between the country's regional ambitions and crackdowns on INGOs. 

As with Egypt, behind-the-scenes preemptive shaming provides a glimpse into how reputation may have factored into Russia's civil society regulations. At the same time, similar to the results of the statistical model, reputational effects can go both ways—expanding or constricting civil society space—and in the absence of stronger evidence, the hypothesis remains inconclusive.  

The passage of Law No. 18-FZ in 2006—the first law to specifically target international and foreign-connected NGOs—coincided with an EU-Russia summit in Sochi in May, followed by the G8 summit in St. Petersburg in July. As the Russian government prepared to host their counterparts from North America and Europe, some Russian officials privately expressed their dismay that the newly passed 2006 law would not "project a favorable image of [Russia's] activities" at the summits [@06MOSCOW4435a]. In meetings with government officials, the US ambassador took advantage of this unease and appealed to Russia's reputation and international image in an effort to lighten some of the restrictions on US-related INGOs. In a meeting with the foreign minister in late March [@06MOSCOW2928a], and later in a meeting with Putin's Special Representative for Issues of Development of Relations with the European Union in late April, the US ambassador discussed how Russia could improve its international image. The ambassador suggested that the Russian government launch a media campaign to provide details about the NGO registration process and that Putin dedicate a portion of his state of the nation address to clarifying the reasons for passing the law [@06MOSCOW4435a]. Both the foreign minister and the special representative agreed with the ambassador and said they would bring up the suggestions with Putin. It appeared that appeals to reputation could be a useful tactic.

However, in a meeting with one of Putin's presidential aides in May, the US ambassador suggested that the Kremlin try to facilitate the registration of some prominent INGOs prior to the G8 summit as proof that the law was not part of a broad assault on NGOs. The aide rejected the idea, stating that Russia was "not inclined to 'do favors' for the West, which would pocket such steps and continue criticizing Russia with no acknowledgment of positive moves" [@06MOSCOW5372a]. Putin feared losing control over Russian *gosudarstvennost,* and following US suggestions posed several risks to Putin's notion of sovereignty. If Putin complied with US requests, he would (1) be supporting US foreign policy and INGOs like the NED, NDI, and IRI that were subject to registration, and (2) foreclose future opportunities to crack down on these organizations, and (3) risk attracting international criticism and shame from the United States later on. To protect Russia's future reputation, Putin avoided broaching the issue of the 2006 law at the G8 summit. The fact that Putin rejected US advice before the G8 summit in 2006, may indicate that he was likely less susceptible to reputational pressure. However, with the evidence available, it is impossible to determine how influential reputational concerns were in Russia's regulation of civil society.

# China

The case of China illustrates how authoritarian regimes can redefine their relationship with international civil society in order to increase their domestic stability and boost their international reputation. In contrast to the typical authoritarian response of attempting to absorb rival political institutions into the regime, China's strategy for balancing and neutralizing the destabilizing effect of these different actors has been to give them limited, regulated autonomy. The preeminent example of this phenomenon has been the country's rapid capitalist economic expansion, which has been tightly regulated to ensure its compatibility with the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). From 2004–2016, China treated some international NGOs similarly, partnering directly with foreign NGOs to enhance service delivery, education, disaster response, and environmental protections throughout the country. International NGOs have been "caught up in the larger struggle… to craft a stronger party and a stronger China" [@icnl-china].

In this final case study, I outline the development of China's regulatory environment for international NGOs, once again comparing predictions from the statistical model with qualitative evidence. I examine how domestic unrest and fears of regime cohesion have been the primary motivation for China's regulation of global civil society, ultimately resulting in a 2017 law targeted specifically at INGOs. I also examine the minimal role of external risk and the more substantial role of reputational concerns on the country's civil society regulatory environment. @fig:timeline-chn presents a timeline of each of these key factors.

![Timeline of de jure and de facto NGO regulations in China](../../Output/figures/2-timeline-chn){#fig:timeline-chn}

## Internal stability

### Corporatist civil society

In some aspects, China's early regulation of civil society mirrored Egypt, though on a much larger scale. Following the 1949 Chinese Revolution, Mao Zedong moved quickly to consolidate his power and neutralize the most threatening institutional challengers to his regime. As part of his Great Leap Forward program, Mao confiscated land and property from the country's landlord class and redistributed it to peasants, killing hundreds of thousands of landowners in the process [@Rummel:1991]. Mao moved against the former Kuomintang (KMT) nationalist party in the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, executing as many as 2 million KMT members and arresting hundreds of thousands more [@Changyu:2005]. In addition to targeting the country's core economic and political institutions, Mao dismantled social institutions, shuttering all civil society organizations, including religious associations, professional societies, labor unions, and a handful of early international NGOs like the Red Cross [@Yin:2009, 521]. These dramatic and bloody moves against his rivals permitted Mao to consolidate his party's rule and assert direct control over most of the country's institutions. 

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) dominated civil society until the 1970s, maintaining strict control over civic and associational life. Foreign associations were barred from the country, and private citizens joined government-run social groups, or *danweis*, which provided for their welfare needs. A handful of government operated NGOs (GONGOs) were permitted, including the Chinese Red Cross, trade associations, and cultural exchange groups, but these were closely monitored and acted as extensions of the CCP [@KallmanClark:2016, 172]. After Mao's death in 1976, China launched a series of liberalizing reforms that restructured the country's economy and opened the country up to the forces of globalization. In concert with the country's economic expansion, Deng Xiaoping and the CCP experimented with formally expanding civic space and passed regulations to create foundations and social organizations. The first formal Chinese foundation was opened in 1988, followed by dozens of social organizations, and by the end of 2008, there were nearly 1,600 officially registered civil society organizations [@KallmanClark:2016, 173].

The relationship between these new forms of civil society and the government followed a corporatist pattern seen in other authoritarian states. The CCP was closely linked to civil society, and regulations helped ensure that social organizations could work as an arm of the government. In 1997, a government official described two purposes of China's growing domestic civil society, encapsulating its corporatist, regime-linked purpose: "first, to communicate the ideas of the people to the Party and government and, second, to engage in activities that serve the public" [@HsiaWhite:2002, 331]. Civil society was thus created to serve the needs and expand the reach of the state. Domestic social organizations were seen as a "transmission belt" for CCP policies, "rather than as autonomous social actors that can monitor the government and ensure that disadvantaged groups are not ignored" [@HsiaWhite:2002, 332]. The regulatory environment for NGOs was highly restrictive (see @fig:timeline-chn), and organizations were largely constrained by state preferences. International NGOs—including the Ford Foundation and Save the Children—found ways around these strict corporatist laws and set up offices in the country as private, for-profit "foreign enterprises," but these organizations were relatively limited in their reach.

The CCP managed this expansion of civic space carefully, paying attention to concerns of regime cohesion and domestic stability. Following the predictions of the statistical model, civil society remained highly restrictive as the government faced rising domestic unrest and increasing regime cohesion between 1995 and 2000. Though the CCP created legal avenues for formal civil society—ostensibly expanding civic space—it ensured that these organizational forms were highly regulated and aligned with government preferences. 

### Big Society, Small Government, and a departure from corporatism

In 2004, under the leadership of president Hu Jintao, the Chinese Communist Party endorsed an ambitious new agenda aimed at radically reshaping state–civil society relations. The CCP's "Big Society, Small Government" initiative was designed to create a

> system of social protection, including social security, social assistance, and charitable undertakings [in which] civilian organizations have become bridges and belts linking the Party and government with the mass, an indispensable force to promote economic development and social progress, and play an important role in the harmonious development of a socialist civilization [@Boychuk:2007, 201].

The "bridges and belts" analogy in this 2004 pronouncement was consistent with China's previous corporatist approach to civil society, viewing it as a link between the government and society. However, in practice, the "Big Society, Small Government" agenda signaled a significant shift in how the CCP dealt with civil society, leading to a redefinition of the two actors' relationship. Over the next decade, strict corporatism gave way to limited cooperation and autonomy. Under this new relationship—what @Spires:2011 has termed "contingent symbiosis" —as long as NGOs and civil society organizations helped advance the state's goals and did not lobby explicitly for democratization, the government provided significant allowance for innovation and even some degree of advocacy. 

Instead of treating civil society organizations as direct extensions of the state, the CCP began to view their relationship within a vertical hierarchy of control, with highly regulated GONGOs at the top and unregistered, autonomous, grassroots NGOs at the bottom [@RichterHatch:2013]. This new arrangement was designed to encourage collaboration with the state in specific domains, providing organizations at the bottom of the hierarchy with substantial freedom in pursuing their missions. The CCP enshrined this new relationship in a series of laws in 2004, 2006, and 2009 regulating foundations, social organizations, and foreign enterprises, making it easier for domestic and international NGOs to register, operate, and cooperate with government officials.

Growing domestic stability contributed to the CCP's turn away from strict corporatism—by the time Hu Jintao came to office in 2003, the domestic unrest of the late 1990s and early 2000s had begun to improve. More importantly, though, the shift away from corporatism allowed the CCP to derive direct benefits from cooperating with domestic and international NGOs, particularly in non-contentious issue areas like the environment, disability rights, public health, and urban renewal. Making legal concessions to some civil society organization could lead to enhanced state capacity, which in turn could shore up the CCP's legitimacy at home and improve its stability-seeking calculus. As such, the CCP worked to cooperate with and "foster certain types of foreign NGOs and to quell those with politically sensitive agendas" [@Yin:2009, 536] in an effort to maintain internal regime stability.

By operating within the bounds set by the government and working on safe regime-compatible issues, INGOs could enjoy substantial autonomy. In 2002, Hsia and White offered controversial advice to nonprofit practitioners interested in running international NGOs in China, encouraging them to partner with local government officials. They note that although maintaining close connections to these officials could lead to a relationship that was "too close for comfort," "working in isolation of the government [was] scarcely an option [and] choosing helpful government agencies as partners [was] vitally important" [@HsiaWhite:2002, 347–48]. In many cases, government officials turned a blind eye to organizations' legal status (or lack thereof). In 2004, China Development Brief—a nonprofit organization that monitored nonprofit legal developments in the country—explained how INGOs could avoid the bureaucratic red tape associated with registration: 

> If you can show that you are cooperating with a recognised Chinese agency, and if you are not doing anything that is particularly contentious or sensitive, it is unlikely that you will encounter any kind of trouble arising from not having official registration and status, apart from the practical difficulties of not being able to open a bank account in the name of the organisation.[^16]

Beyond simply staying within regime boundaries, some INGOs working under Hu Jintao's regime were able to push and redefine those boundaries, becoming co-architects of those regulations [@Teets:2014, 145]. Research by @Teets:2014 shows how several environmental INGOs have taken advantage of close connections with government officials to create a more favorable regulatory environment, inviting officials to special conferences, hiring retired officials with connections to sitting bureaucrats, and publicly shaming supervisory agencies that impose harsher regulations [@HeissKelley:2017].

However, the practical effects of this apparent move away from corporatism did not register on the country's CSRE index until the end of Hu's presidency (see @fig:timeline-chn). Though NGOs saw some increased autonomy, and some well-funded, highly flexible INGOs were able to shape their regulations, for the vast majority of civil society organizations, the regulatory environment remained largely closed. Driven by the need to balance out other institutional challengers and preserve regime cohesion, the CCP successfully created a legal environment that allowed them to maximize the benefits of domestic and international civil society activities while keeping the sector under careful control. 

### A return to corporatism?

After taking office in 2013, Xi Jinping faced declining domestic stability and the country witnessed a series of violent attacks and large scale protests throughout 2014–15. Spurred on by this growing domestic unrest (again, as predicted by the model), Xi moved to close civic space and regain control over the balance of political actors. At the end of 2015, Xi approved a new anti-terrorism law that was designed to give the government more authority to respond to what it claimed was an increase in violence from Uyghur separatists. Commentators noted, though, that the law also gave Xi a pretext to assert more control over the popular unrest, taking advantage of a global rise in terrorist attacks "to increase [the CCP's] control over the domestic population."[^17] In addition to the terrorism law, Xi moved against international NGOs, proposing legislation in 2015 that would constrict the limited autonomy some had enjoyed under Hu.

A key characteristic of Hu's turn away from corporatism was the differential treatment given to INGOs. Broadly speaking, organizations working on less contentious issues were treated differently from those working on human rights, freedom of expression, democracy promotion, and other contentious topics. proposed legislation that would codify this differential treatment, formally cutting off contentious INGOs and closely regulating non-contentious organizations. After months of debate within the ministries charged with regulating INGOs, and consultation with prominent INGO staff and consultants, the law was approved in mid-2016 and took effect on January 1, 2017. 

Article 3 of the 2017 Overseas NGO Law formally defines a host of permissible specific issue areas and establishes the regime's new ideal level of civil society activity: 

> Overseas NGOs that work in fields such as the economy, education, science and technology, culture, health, sports, environmental protection and in areas such as poverty alleviation and disaster relief may carry out activities that legally aid the development of public welfare in accordance with this Law.

Beyond representing the CCP's new ideal point, the new Overseas NGO Law has significant ramifications for the relationship between the government and INGOs, signaling an end of contingent symbiosis, a possible return to corporatism, and more importantly, "a closing to the world" [@Sidel:2016]. The law reframes INGOs as possible partners in development and civil society to potential security threats, requiring that all foreign organizations register with the Ministry of Public Safety instead of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Additionally, the law puts INGOs in incredibly close alignment with the regime, requiring that all foreign organizations find a pre-approved government agency or GONGO to act as its Professional Supervisory Unit (PSU) prior to registering with the Ministry of Public Safety. INGOs had previously been required to partner with PSUs under the "Big Society, Small Government" laws, but the regulations were rarely enforced as long as the organization stayed in the good graces of the CCP. Between 2004–2016, only 29 international NGOs managed to officially partner with a PSU,[^18] and since January 2017, INGOs have struggled to find PSUs willing to take them on. Because of the uncertainty, distrust, and possible security consequences associated with collaborating with INGOs, many potential PSUs have declined to work with overseas NGOs out of fear of risking their agency's reputation and individual careers. As of April 2017, 62 INGOs had successfully registered with the Ministry of Public Security—a fraction of the estimated 7,000 organizations affected by the law.[^19]

As with the 2015 terrorism law, rising domestic instability in China led Xi to reassert control over international civil society and eliminate the legal grey areas INGOs had been able to manipulate.[^20] The 2017 Overseas NGO marked the end of the move away from corporatist regime–civil society relations (as minuscule as the 2004–2016 had been), signaling that "INGOs were no longer seen as helpful to Chinese civic life, but instead as a threat" [@Plantan:2016].

## External risk

TODO

Instability from neighbors not much of an issue - few coups, few protests abroad

> There is some external threat - worried about western espionage - South China Sea - Western plots against China - nationalism - hard to tell if that's true [^21]

Influence from abroad is a concern, but not because of revolutionary contagion - more like social, education, political contagion

Chinese NGO leaders are educated abroad and remain involved in issue area networks - "By socializing Chinese NGO activists, global civil society has shaped the development of the third sector in China" [@Wang:2012, 109]

@Yin:2009
15 - Government worried about foreign NGOs too - they pose a "potential national threat" 

2006 article in CCP newspaper warned that they "undermine national security," "destroy political stability," foster corruption," and "propagate foreign practices" and "spy on and gather information on China's military, political, and economic information" 

Too much foreign associational life "may lead to adoption of Western ideas of liberty" 

16 - Also fears of color revolution and "peaceful transformation" 

## Reputation

TODO

China cares about international reputation to a point - Olympics in 2008

Reputation in @Wang:2012, 113 - China more careful when dealing with foreign NGOs because of concerns over China's international image - government tolerates foreign NGOs, tacitly allows them to work - some INGOs aren't registered, some are registered as for-profit organizations, some are affiliated with universities - see also @HsiaWhite:2002 

@Yin:2009

14 - Huge reputational concerns: "The Chinese government’s increased tolerance of foreign social groups has also resulted from the government’s desire to achieve greater influence on the international front. China has benefited significantly from the opening-up policy; it has realized that it cannot develop in isolation from the rest of the world and that its development and prosperity are interrelated with and dependent on that of the world as a whole. As a result, China has been actively seeking to join the globalization process and be accepted into the global village. At the same time, with surging economic strength, China is trying to get rid of its old image as “backward and weak” and desires to be recognized as a strong and responsible nation that can be influential in world affairs. On the one hand, more than ever before, China cares about the views and attitudes of the international community toward it. On the other hand, China faces increasing international pressure to live up to international standards. Due to the special role of international NGOs in international society, cooperating with international NGOs will no doubt further China’s goal of gaining recognition and influence worldwide. Thus, the Chinese government regards cooperation with international NGOs as part of its opening-up and as an inevitable element in the pursuit of globalization." 

# Conclusion

TODO

Compare Egypt, China, and Russia - similarities in how/why they regulate INGOs

While Egypt and Russia have passed few formal laws regarding civil society, leaving lots of room of discretion and arbitrary enforcement, China has followed a different pattern.


- China: reputation/internal
- Egypt: internal/external
- Russia: internal/external

So what?

Return to each hypothesis, since the SNA should reinforce LNA

but that the issue was "'not urgent' like the revisions to the 
election law or the new anti-terror law
Internal concerns are most important - Only in the case of Russia do external concerns play much of a role.

Long-standing dictatorships with more consolidated power are more likely to restrict civil society as they don't need to allow for dissonance and don't need to make concessions to NGOs—domestic and international.

Domestic unrest leads to more crackdowns

External stuff…

Reputation. In the statistics, there was no clear evidence of a reputational effect—it went either way. The Russian case study showed no effect. Egypt showed a possible inkling of an effect—Law 84 was not reformed following comment from the US, but drawing a causal link there isn't possible. Law 84 didn't get formally revised until May 2017
China, though, shows X


Benefits to combining LNA and SNA. Small details and nuances of the individual cases obscure trends in the statistical model - like Egypt's external threats. The model missed the effects of the Second Intifada in Palestine, which encouraged the development of Law 84 of 2002 and gave Mubarak extraordinary discretionary power in dealing with NGOs, and the model overstated the effect of the Arab Spring on Egypt's spontaneously improved CSRE in 2011–2012. While unrest did indeed precede the expansion of civil society, it is highly unlikely that it played a direct causal role—SCAF and Morsi expanded and contracted the space for civil society largely in reaction to internal political crises and challenges to regime cohesion, not because they feared a spillover of protests from Tunisia or Libya.

The model also missed Color Revolutions
Measurement error likely hides the overriding explanatory factor for these new restrictions. are not reflected in the regional or subregional risk score
As with the Color Revolutions preceding Russia's 2006 INGO law, the statistical model again fails to account for external instability and fears of contagion. 

Gosudarstvennost and Russian protection against global threats, not just regional threats -the model can't capture that, and it was a critical part of why Russia has cracked down on INGOs


Egypt and Russian both enshrine regime preferences in rare-ish laws and use tons of discretion in applying the laws - lets them be highly responsive to domestic pressures, threats to regime cohesion and stability, and threats from abroad. Gives them flexibility too - they can target both domestic and international NGOs as needed. Law 84 (and now law whatever) allows Egypt to shut down local human rights NGOs *and* large international NGOs like Amnesty and IRI. Russia's 2012 and 2015 laws are wielded similarly—Putin can use them to shut down local NGOs, kick out international NGOs like Amnesty, OSF, IRI

[^22] + other laws, like protests laws, the penal code - discretion allowed regime to use civil society to maintain stability + stop NGOs that got too unruly - Egypt had little change in formal legislation between 2002 and 2017 because the 2002 law allowed for a lot of discretion - (2012 version of ICNL monitor says "Law 84 of 2002 is not so much restrictive as it is discretionary. Law 84 of 2002 gives enormous discretionary powers to the Ministry of Social Solidarity.")
