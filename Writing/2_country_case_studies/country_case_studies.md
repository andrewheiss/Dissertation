While the statistical models in the previous chapter provide some observational evidence for the internal, external, and reputational determinants of authoritarian restrictions on global civil society, there are limits in what the statistics can reveal. 


In this chapter, I analyze how the mechanisms of internal risk, external threats, and international reputation influence the development of specific laws governing international civil society, or the regime's ideal point in the model of amicable contempt (see @fig:theory-regime-dot). Based on the model

# Egypt

Egypt illustrates the importance of internal regime consolidate and domestic political unrest in a dictator's decision to regulate domestic and international civil society. A persistent thread running through the development of Egypt's NGO regulatory environment is that of control—each law dealing with civil society was designed to provide maximum political benefit to the ruling party by delineating the allowable space for NGO action. The case also shows how different Egyptian regimes have prioritized civil society as a political institution. Prior to the 2011 uprising, domestic and international NGOs were treated as a low priority, something rules got around to regulating after consolidating their power and balancing out other challengers to their stability. The kinetic political environment following 2011 Mubarak's resignation, though, reshaped regime–civil society relations. International NGOs that had previously been expelled, such as the International Republican Institute (IRI), were invited back to observe elections, along with other prominent human rights INGOs like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. After this initial and unprecedented opening of civic space, the door to international advocacy was slammed shut at the end of 2011. Fears of domestic unrest, as well as shifting internal regime cohesion, led to a dramatic constriction of the country's civil society regulatory environment. In this case study, I compare the predictions of the statistical model with qualitative evidence from Egypt's approach to regulating domestic and international civil society. I trace how internal factors—regime cohesion and domestic unrest—propelled the the development of Egypt's regulatory and legal system. I also briefly investigate how regional political risk from abroad—including uprisings in Palestine in 2000–2005 and the protests in Tunisia, Libya, and elsewhere in 2011—played an important (though lesser) role in shaping Egyptian civil society regulations. @fig:timeline-egy shows an overview of the variables from the statistical models since 1995, overlaid with a timeline of Egypt's different regimes and potentially destabilizing events.

## Domestic unrest and regime cohesion

According to the results of the statistical model, regimes with greater internal cohesion and longer tenure are more likely to restrict the civil society regulatory environment. One possible explanation for this unexpected prediction is that though civil society is one of many institutions dictators need to deal with, it is less important than other actors that pose more of an immediate threat. As regimes gain more power and stability, they see less of a need to leave civil society unregulated, and domestic political crises in older, consolidated regimes can lead to formal legislation that restricts civil society. The experience of Egypt offers a prime example of this dynamic.

### Civil society and internal threats to stability under Nasser

Egypt's first foray into regulating civil society in 1964 came after years of political consolidation. After coming to power in the Free Officers revolution in 1952, president Gamal Abdel Nasser spent the first decade of his rule balancing the most dangerous institutional challengers to his regime. In 1952, Nasser undertook massive land reforms that redistributed land to the landless and increase the country's agricultural production. More importantly for the internal politics of his regime, though, the land reforms were designed "to break any political opposition to the revolution from the *ancien régime*'s *pasha* class" [@Bush:2002, 9]. The reforms granted the state the authority to seize land from the former political ruling class and were thus instrumental in balancing out the risk they posed to Nasser's rule. In addition to neutralizing the economic ruling class, Nasser limited opposition from political and religious elites by banning all political parties in 1953 and suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood in 1954, blacklisting former politicians and arresting tens of thousands of Islamists [@Jankowski:2002, 20–23]. These swift and dramatic moves against potential institutional challengers allowed Nasser to consolidate his party's rule and remain in power for nearly two decades.

Having coopted and neutralized key political actors, Nasser turned to other institutional actors that posed less of an immediate threat. In 1964, after more than a decade in office, Nasser helped pass the Law 32 of 1964, or the Civic Association Code—the first piece of legislation related to NGOs in the Middle East. This new law followed Nasser's pattern of subsuming political institutions into the government. NGOs required government approval to be established, and officials were given unlimited discretion and authority to grant or deny registration status. Additionally, officials could dissolve or merge registered NGOs and could replace their boards of directors [@icnl-egypt:2010, 2–3; @Agati:2007]. 

Law 32 of 1964 established a pattern for all future NGO regulations in Egypt. The law gave the government incredible control over Egypt's nascent civil society, but it was rarely followed to the letter. Law 32 served as a marker of the regime's ideal level of NGO activity—the ideal point in the model of amicable contempt—but the regime used discretion to expand or constrict the allowable space around that ideal point. Accordingly, Egyptian civil society organizations found ways to work within that allowable space and adapted to the new regulations. In the early 1980s, NGOs dealing with contentious issues like human rights and women's empowerment avoided the jurisdiction of Law 32 by registering as "civil societies," which were government by the country's civil code, rather than associations, which fell under the purview of the Ministry of Social Affairs [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 105]. Some NGOs were thus able to take advantage of the law's discretion and selected their own regulatory body (though, as I explore in more detail in Chapter 6, such a strategy is only possible when NGOs enjoy large levels of instrumental flexibility). 

Motivated primarily by concerns of domestic stability and internal regime cohesion, the Egyptian government therefore formalized loopholes and discretionary authority into the law—the regime allowed for a degree of institutional dissonance from NGOs and civil society, but reserved the right to step in and stop unwanted activities at its discretion. 

### Civil society and internal threats to stability under Mubarak

Under Nasser, civil society entered into the regime's stability-seeking calculus only after more salient actors had been balanced and controlled. Regulating civil society was put off until the regime had consolidated power. This pattern continued after Nasser's death in 1970. His successor, Anwar Sadat, did little to regulate civil society during his presidency. Sadat reversed many of Nasser's policies, diplomatically aligning Egypt with the United States, signing a peace treaty with neighboring Israel, and launching a wave of neoliberal economic reforms known as the *infitaḥ,* or "opening." Driven by structural adjustment programs sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the *infitaḥ* opened the country to international trade and created new capitalist industries, dramatically reshaping the Egyptian economy.

After Sadat's assassination in 1981, newly-appointed president Ḥosni Mubarak spent the first decade of his rule once again consolidating the regime's power and balancing out potential challengers. While Nasser had marginalized the old economic and political classes, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak faced a radically different institutional landscape, thanks to Sadat's neoliberal economic reforms. Fueled by economic expansion in the 1980s and early 1990s, labor unions and a growing capitalist class posed a possible threat to Mubarak's new regime, especially since capital and labor have historically tended to be "the agents of democratization, not the allies of authoritarianism" [@Bellin:2002, 2]. To prevent these new economic classes from obtaining too much power, Mubarak structured economic reforms in ways that linked both labor and capital to his regime, supporting and co-opting labor unions, sponsoring industrial development projects, and incorporating capitalists into his cabinet and inner circle. As a result, the government stunted these actors' possible commitment to democratization and neutralized their risk. Throughout this consolidation of labor and capital during the 1980s and 90s, Mubarak paid little attention to domestic or international civil society—it was not a priority. This changed in the mid-1990s when, following with the predictions of the statistical model, escalating domestic instability at home combined with increasing internal regime consolidation to set the stage for the first statutory constriction of civil society since 1964. 

Between 1992–1997, militant Islamist groups carried out dozens of attacks throughout the country, killing more than 1,000 Egyptian civilians during a five-year insurgency. The offensive gripped the Egyptian media as the insurgents undertook high profile attacks, including an assassination attempt on Mubarak during a state visit to Ethiopia in 1995. At the height of the insurgency in November 1997, members of al-Gamaʿa al-Islamiyya gunned down 70 people—including 60 foreign tourists—in front of the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor [@Wright:2007, 243, 290–93]. Following the Luxor massacre, the government responded by limiting institutional dissonance across the board. In particular, because insurgent groups had been receiving funds from abroad, any institution connected with foreign countries became suspect—including domestic NGOs funded by foreign grants and international NGOs run by foreign employees. In 1998, state-run newspapers and television launched a media campaign linking foreign funding of NGOs to "dubious activities, corruption, profiteering" and labelled foreign-backed NGOs as threats to national security [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 113].

After stoking popular resentment against NGOs, Mubarak worked with the lower house of parliament to draft and pass new legislation to replace Law 32 of 1964. The subsequent Law 153 of 1999 allowed the regime to bring human rights NGOs under the umbrella of the state, ostensibly closing off the loophole they had previously relied on to avoid the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The passage of this law shifted the regime's ideal point to the left, institutionalizing its reduced preferences for civil society activity. Accordingly, following the model, the size of the overlap in preferences—or the practical operating environment—shrunk. The provisions of the new law eliminated some of the "margin of free movement" that NGOs had previously enjoyed [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 120], gave the government jurisdiction over any organization "whose objectives or activities were similar to those of NGOs, even if it assumed a legal form that was different from that of NGOs and institutions," and forced hundreds of organizations to re-register [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 118].

However, in a move that frustrated this attempt to gain more control over civil society, the Egyptian Constitutional Court ruled Law 153 of 1999 unconstitutional the following year, declaring that it had been passed without consulting the country's upper house of parliament and that its provisions limiting civic space violated constitutional protections guaranteeing freedom of association. Reeling from this setback, the regime quietly tweaked the rejected law and passed it through both houses of parliament without public fanfare, resulting in Law 84 of 2002, or the Law on Associations and Foundations [@Agati:2007, 60]. In addition to requiring that all NGOs register with the Ministry of Social Solidarity, the new law imposed specific limits on international and foreign-connected NGOs. Any revenue from foreign associations to nonprofit organizations working in Egypt required both recipients and donors to submit multiple applications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and state security, and the latter maintained ultimate veto power over the approval process [@Thabet:2004, 162]. 

In response to domestic crises and a spike in terrorism, the Mubarak regime formally redefined its ideal point. But, as seen in @fig:timeline-egy, the de facto CSRE remained constant after 2002. Though it granted the government substantial oversight power over NGOs, Law 84 also allowed for enormous discretion in enforcement. According to an Egyptian academic cited in a 2010 US embassy cable, the vast majority of Egyptian NGOs adhered to Law 84 obligations and registered with the Ministry of Social Solidarity. NGOs that did not register generally worked on contentious human rights-related issues [@10CAIRO217a], or had foreign connections. Though contentious foreign-sponsored and international NGOs were more likely to resist attempts at registering, many were able to navigate legal loopholes that Law 84 was supposed to have closed. Some NGOs registered as nonprofit "civil companies" rather than advocacy organizations, thus avoiding oversight from the Ministry of Social Affairs [@10CAIRO217a]. In 2007, there were rumors that the government was considering closing this civil companies loophole [@07CAIRO2067a], but such reforms never materialized and organizations continued to creatively maneuver the legal environment. 

While it might appear that Law 84's discretionary provisions gave NGOs substantial latitude, discretion cut both ways. Allowing NGOs to register under different ministries encourages registration, which in turn links organizations more directly to the government and creates a patron-client relationship, thus improves government's chances of capturing NGO resources. One observer described the impact of this Law 84-enabled patronage, explaining:

> The government takes control by division and segregation and affiliates them [NGOs] to a different minister. Everyone in civil society has a godfather. Even if they're useful, they're corrupt. … Even the Boy Scout movement was completely destroyed [@Sissions:2005, 5].

Additionally, if an organization becomes too contentious and poses a threat to the regime, officials can use minor infractions in more obscure parts of the law to fine or shut down the NGO. For instance, the stated legal pretext for the December 2011 raids on INGOs was that the organizations were not officially registered and thus in violation of Law 84. However, as I will show in Chapter 6, each of the organizations had registration packets pending with the relevant ministries. The International Republican Institute, in particular, first applied for formal registration status in 2006 and was told that they could work in the country as long as the application was in process.[^1] When facing increased domestic instability, though, ministry officials revoked this discretion and expelled the organization.

### Civil society and internal threats to stability after 2011

Maintaining institutional balance is essential for autocrats to remain in power. In their early years, Nasser and Mubarak both focused their attention on coopting and neutralizing more powerful political actors, including politicians, parliament, the judicial system, Islamist movements, capitalists, and labor unions. After consolidating their power, both presidents turned to the management of civil society, which posed less of a threat to the regime and thus was a lower priority. Mubarak's Minister of Social Solidarity explained as much in a conversation with the US ambassador to Egypt in 2007, noting that the government was considering revisions to Law 84, but that the issue was "'not urgent' like the revisions to the election law or the new anti-terror law" [@07CAIRO2200a]. 

Following the 2011 uprising, however, the importance of civil society as an institution—in particular foreign-connected and international NGOs—would reverse and take center stage as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), Morsi, and Sisi sought to consolidate power and regain regime cohesion and stability. The statistical model predicts that domestic unrest leads to crackdowns on domestic and international NGOs, while newer, less cohesive regimes are more likely to allow for more institutional dissonance and expand the allowable space for civil society action. Both of these countervailing forces have played a crucial role in post-revolutionary Egypt and help explain the closure of civic space in the country. 

In the immediate aftermath of Mubarak's ouster in February 2011, civic space in Egypt saw an unprecedented opening and expansion under the rule of Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. As seen in @fig:timeline-egy, the CSRE jumped from −1.7 in 2010 to −0.6 at the end of 2012, the highest in the country's history. Law 84 continued to govern state–civil society relations, but SCAF's arbitrary enforcement of the law decreased substantially. Following the model, SCAF's lack of internal cohesion and its short time in office contributed to its openness to civil society. Evidence bears this out, as the military made public concessions to international NGOs and local human rights activists in an effort to demonstrate its commitment to reform and democratization. Domestic human rights NGOs and activist bloggers that had been involved in the revolution continued their political advocacy and spoke up against SCAF abuses and crackdowns. Citizens formed *ligān shaʿbiya*—informal popular committees and unregistered NGOs—that engaged in contentious community advocacy, mobilizing voters for constitutional referenda and parliamentary elections, demanding improved social services for their neighborhoods, and exposing corrupt local officials and police who had violated human rights [@El-Meehy:2016].

International human rights NGOs played a growing role as well: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch (HRW), IRI, NDI, and other organizations that had previously been banned or heavily restricted were invited to return. IRI and NDI consulted with electoral committees to prepare for a slew of upcoming elections. Amnesty and HRW held direct meetings with military officials and confronted them with reports of human rights abuses. In June 2011, for instance, a delegation from HRW  met with military officers and interim politicians and called on SCAF to pursue legal action against former Mubarak-era officials, end its widespread use of military trials for civilians, and investigate allegations of torture and virginity tests used against protesters [@hrw:2011a].[^2] That same month, Amnesty staff in Cairo met with General ʿAbd al-Fattaḥ al-Sīsī (then a member of SCAF) about the charges of virginity testing. As a result of the meeting, Sisi committed to ending the practice of testing women and promised to avoid detaining women in the future. The general also urged Egyptians to hold the military accountable, saying that "people alleging human rights abuses at the hands of the army should complain to the military prosecutor, and can also post their complaints on the SCAF Facebook page" [@amnesty:2011]. This apparent openness to popular criticism was a small concession to domestic and international watchdog NGOs, but it was mostly symbolic—in 2011 there were 4.7 million Egyptians Facebook users [@SalemMourtada:2011, 4]—representing only 6% of the country's population—and SCAF heavily moderated its page and regularly deleted comments.[^3] 

Amid this apparent expansion of civic space and the growing involvement of international civil society in Egyptian politics, at the end of 2011, domestic tensions and instability reversed the trend, fitting once again with the model's predictions. In the interest of consolidating its power, SCAF worked throughout the year to curtail protests and often resorted to violence to break up demonstrations, including the massacre of 28 protesters at the state media headquarters in October.[^4] For most of 2011, SCAF's crackdown was aimed at individual protesters, not at civil society organizations themselves. This changed in December, though, when Egyptian security forces raided the offices of 17 local and international NGOs [@FadelWarrick:2011]—including Freedom House, NDI, and IRI—and arrested dozens of domestic and international NGO employees. The domestic unrest that had led to the October massacre continued to foment during the parliamentary elections, and protesters in turn continued to demonstrate in downtown Cairo. The tension culminated on December 16, when military troops filled Tahrir Square to put down an anti-SCAF demonstration. The breakup led to three days of intense clashes between the military and protestors, with 10 civilians dead and 441 wounded.[^5] The military's coordinated raids on INGO offices came two weeks later.

The interplay between regime consolidation and domestic stability explain SCAF's sudden closure of civic space and crackdown on international civil society. Prior to the parliamentary elections, SCAF had been careful to allow for popular protests and court INGOs like Amnesty and IRI. Showing deference to these actors helped with the caretaker regime's institutional balancing and allowed SCAF to show that it was responsive to its citizens—an important strategy, given that the previous regime had just been overthrown because of popular unrest and anger over Mubarak's repressive government. As domestic stability worsened during 2011, SCAF maintained a fairly open and courteous relationship with INGOs and local civil society until parliamentary elections began. In the first two rounds of elections, politicians friendly to SCAF won—a sign that the regime's internal cohesion was strengthening, that "the Egyptian public [was] on its side," [@ap-egypt-protests:2011] and that SCAF was mastering the institutional balance. 

Egypt held its first post-revolutionary elections in June 2012, and Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, won the presidency. The military—which had cemented itself as a central and popular player in Egyptian politics—moved to the background but watched Morsi's rule from the sidelines, ready to intervene when their interests were threatened [@Cook:2007]. Morsi's short presidency was marked with internal domestic chaos and rapidly collapsing regime cohesion. Following the statistical model, Morsi should have held off from regulating civil society in his early years, focusing instead on neutralizing other political challengers like the parliament, courts, and military. However, the unrest that SCAF had faced in 2011–2012 continued unabated—the military was reluctant to hand off the reigns of government and dissolved the newly elected parliament, protesters still occupied Tahrir Square, and a growing insurgency in the Sinai had killed dozens of police and soldiers. This overwhelming instability led Morsi to attempt to challenge and balance out smaller institutional actors like domestic and international civil society. 

In December 2012, Morsi announced new draft legislation that would nationalize all civil society organizations and fold them into the Ministry of Social Affairs—NGO staff would be considered civil servants and would fall under complete control of the government [@ngo-law:2012]. The proposal was temporarily tabled following strong backlash from dozens of human and civil rights groups, but it reappeared in February 2013 when the Ministry submitted a final draft of the law to parliament with additional restrictions—prohibiting NGOs from participating in political activities, requiring the retroactive registration of 40,000 organizations, and creating additional bureaucratic hurdles to receive approval for most aid projects [@Halawa:2013; @cihrs:2013]. In a display of its commitment to restrict civil society, the Morsi's regime completed the public prosecution of Case 173 of 2011—the trial against the 43 NGO and INGO workers arrested during the December 2011 raids. In June 2013, the court sentenced the defendants (both Egyptian and foreign) to 1–5-year prison terms for violating Law 84 and a handful of articles in the country's penal code.

Despite this public show of force against international civil society, Morsi ran out of time to push his draft legislation through parliament.[^6] Morsi ultimately was unable to successfully balance rival institutions, and in the summer of 2013, the military reasserted its power. During the last two weeks of June, military leaders conducted more than forty attacks on Muslim Brotherhood offices and party headquarters, putting immense destabilizing pressure on Morsi's regime in Cairo [@Ketchley:2017]. These attacks were followed by a mass popular protest—on June 30, hundreds of thousands of protesters flocked to Tahrir Square to demand the president's resignation. However, this popular anti-Morsi movement, named Tamarod ("rebellion") was not spontaneous or autonomous—recent research has found that this rebellion against Morsi's regime was manufactured by the military, who secretly funneled money and directions to Tamarod's leaders [@Ketchley:2017]. Following Morsi's resignation on July 3, the military arrested him and dozens of members of his administration and rounded up party officials around the country. Morsi's treatment of civil society went contrary to what the statistical model predicts. However, the circumstances of Morsi's his brief presidential rule seem to prove the exception to the model and explain the divergence in the country's actual CSRE and the model's predicted CSRE. Previous regimes made concessions to civil society early in their terms, and then later withdrew their support and imposed stricter laws to formalize their preferences regarding their relationship to civil society. In the face of a deep domestic political crisis, though, Morsi moved against civil society—and all other political institutions—much more quickly. In the end, he was unable to balance out any institutional challenger—including civil society—and his regime ended.

In July 2013, under the command of General Sisi, the military installed Adly Mansour, the Chief Justice of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, as the temporary president. Mansour in turn appointed Sisi as his Minister of Defense, and in June 2014, Sisi won the first post-coup presidential election. As defense minister and as president Sisi intensified Morsi's attack on domestic and international civil society. This expanded crackdown again goes against the model's predictions—civil society restrictions should come after a regime has been in power for a while. But Sisi was not new to Egyptian politics. Under his direction, the military had ruled behind the scenes since February 2011, and he himself was a top minister during SCAF's rule. As with the military's crackdown on international NGOs at the end of 2011, Adly and Sisi enjoyed immense popular support for their coup against Morsi and could thus afford to not make concessions to civil society organizations. 

Additionally, growing domestic unrest provided additional pretext for expanding the crackdown. Insurgent attacks in the Sinai intensified and dozens of soldiers were killed. More importantly, though, the new regime faced growing opposition from the now-disenfranchised Muslim Brotherhood. Members of the Brotherhood held regular protests for weeks after the July 2013 coup, questioning the authority of the transition government and calling for early presidential elections. Between July and August 2013, military and police forces killed more than 1,150 demonstrators, and wounded and arrested thousands more. In the most egregious case, on August 14, military personnel used armored personnel carriers, bulldozers, snipers, and infantry in a raid on a Brotherhood encampment in Rābʿa Square in Eastern Cairo, killing between 800–1,000 protesters in a single day [@hrw:2014]. 

The regime's cohesion and a domestic political crisis that was rapidly spiraling out of control provided the conditions for a constriction of the civil society regulatory environment, and—in accordance with the model—Sisi quickly moved against domestic and international human rights organizations. In July 2014, a month after taking office, Sisi resurrected Morsi's draft NGO legislation and added additional provisions to give the government and security agencies the authority to dissolve existing NGOs if their activities threatened national unity or posed a threat to national security [@hrw:2014a]. The draft also included strong prohibitions and limitations on foreign funding, restricting international NGOs from paying for their in-country operations or from providing grants to local NGOs. While the Ministry of Social Solidarity worked on refining the draft, Sisi constricted the CSRE by wielding the discretionary authority of Law 84. In 2015 alone, the government shut down more than 500 NGOs, charging the organizations with violations of Law 84, the penal code, terrorism and national security laws, and a new anti-protest law, Law 107 of 2013 [@madamasr:2015]—prosecutors "threw the book" at NGOs it identified as threats.[^7] International NGOs were not immune from the crackdown. In June 2015, Sisi reopened Case 173 of 2011 to expand the charges that had previously been filed against IRI, NDI, and Human Rights Watch.[^8] The directors and staff of dozens of prominent Cairo-based human rights NGO and INGOs have had their assets frozen, have been banned from traveling, or have been arrested since the expansion of Case 173.[^9] Having already consolidated his regime's power, and spurred on by domestic crises, Sisi thus moved against civil society early in his reign and has continued to keep the institution neutralized.

Finally, on May 29, 2017—after years of languishing in draft form—President Sisi signed Law 70 of 2017 on Associations and Other Foundations Working in the Field of Civil Work [@icnl-egypt]. The new law represented a crystallization of Sisi's preference for reduced civil society advocacy, shifting the government's theoretical ideal point further to the left (in the model). Though Law 70 does not completely subsume civil society into a government ministry, as Morsi had originally proposed in 2012, it includes a host of statutory restrictions and penalties, including jail sentences of up to five years and fines reaching one million EGP (≈$55,000). Notably, the law heavily regulates international civil society. Registration fees for foreign NGOs are exceptionally high, and local NGOs—a common recipient of INGO funds—are prohibited from accepting foreign funding without approval from the National Agency to Regulate the Work of Foreign NGOs. This new government agency has 60 days to approve the transfer of funds from abroad, and a lack of a response is considered a rejection—a reversal from Law 84's provision that a non-response constituted approval. Domestic NGOs must also obtain permission from the Ministry of Social Solidarity before they "cooperate with, join, affiliate with, or participate with" any foreign organization, experts, employees, or volunteers. Additionally, domestic NGOs cannot circumvent these laws by becoming INGOs—organizations cannot open branches outside of the country without Ministry approval.  It remains to be seen how restrictive Law 70 will be in practice. The law allows officials to close any NGO that "may harm national security, law and order, public morals, or public health," [@icnl-egypt] giving the government significant interpretive discretion.

## Rising external threats

The development of INGO-related legislation in Egypt has been driven primarily by internal concerns over regime cohesion and domestic unrest. Civil society—including both domestic and international NGOs—has played a role in each regime's stability-seeking calculus, and internal stability (or the lack thereof) shaped the establishment of formal NGO laws and determined the level of de facto discretion used in enforcing those laws. Regional politics have also played an important—albeit less prominent—role in the development of the legal regime for civil society. Contrary to my original hypothesis, the statistical model predicts that the CSRE has a negative relationship with regional political stability—when a country's neighborhood experiences more unrest, coups, and nonviolent protests, it is more likely to make concessions to civil society and expand the regulatory environment for NGOs. 

@fig:timeline-egy shows two decreases in Egypt's neighborhood stability: a slight drop in the late 1990s–early 2000s, followed by a dramatic drop in 2011. Each of these periods of regional instability influenced how Egypt regulated international and domestic civil society. As discussed previously, the major impetus for Mubarak's passage of Law 153 of 1999 and Law 84 of 2002 was the Islamist insurgency raging throughout the country. The passage of new legislation gave Mubarak the ability to better control civil society in the name of national security, helping mitigate and balance out the Islamist threat. Events in neighboring Palestine, however, also shaped the design and implementation of Law 84.

In September 2000, in response to Israeli Prime Minister Arial Sharon's unexpected visit to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, Palestinians began the Second Intifada—or popular uprising—against Israeli occupation. Egyptians had long been sympathetic to Palestinians, but the methods used by the Palestinian resistance during the Intifada worried the government. In the wake of the Islamist insurgency that ended in 1997, Mubarak promised a controlled form of democratization, of which Law 84 was a part. As long as terrorism was contained and warded off, the government would pass laws that appeared to expand civil liberties. "Excessive democracy" could potentially empower terrorists and insurgents, and accordingly, when domestic threats arose, the margin for freedom constricted [@Agati:2007, 61–62]. 

As the Intifada raged on, though, Palestinians carried out suicide bombings and other attacks reminiscent of Egypt's own 1992–97 insurgency. Human rights NGOs in Cairo that supported Palestine thus posed a dilemma—by permitting popular protests in support of the Intifada and allowing NGOs to advocate for Palestinian issues tacitly, the government feared tacitly endorsing tactics that Islamist insurgents had just used in Egypt. In 2000, thousands of students organized the Egyptian Popular Committee for the Support of the Palestinian Intifada (EPCSPI), which led boycott campaigns against Israel and the United States, collected donations to send to Palestine, and held dozens of street protests [@El-Mahdi:2009, 93; @Shehata:2012]. The success of the EPCSPI led to the creation of other similar committees in 2003 in response to the US invasion of Iraq, and some have argued that these early student movements helped set the stage for the mass uprising in 2011 [@Shehata:2012]. 

Law 84 of 2002 helped Mubarak to thread a difficult needle. The student-led popular committees fit well with Mubarak's agenda of controlled democratization, but supporting them could potentially lead to an increase in domestic terrorism. Law 84 was a useful lever for controlling the allowable margin of—its built-in discretionary authority permitted officials to crack down on civil society as needed. The passage of Law 84 amid unrest in Palestine goes against the prediction of the model. More unrest abroad should, in theory, be associated with more concessions to civil society at home, but Law 84 ostensibly gave the government more power to regulate and restrict civil society. Although the regime  reduced its preference for civil society advocacy by shifting its ideal point to the left in @fig:theory-regime-dot, the practical effect of this new law on the CSRE was minimal because of the law's incredible discretionary authority. The CSRE remained stable throughout the 1990s and 2000s, despite the threat of Intifada and the passage of Law 84. The discretion inherent in Law 84 permitted to government to give the *appearance* of concessions to civil society, enabling organizations like EPCSPI to operate while simultaneously providing the government with the ability to target individual NGOs.

In contrast, the more dramatic period of regional instability in 2011 follows the model's prediction that neighborhood unrest is associated with expanded civil society at home. In the immediate aftermath of the 2011 uprising, this was indeed the case—domestic instability and the CSRE index are clearly negatively correlated in @fig:timeline-egy, with each trend line diverging sharply from the other. However, the chain of events does not provide enough evidence to identify regional unrest as the cause of the expansion of the CSRE. 

The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt happened in rapid succession—Tunisia's Ben ʿAli resigned on January 14, 2011, and the protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square began 11 days later on the 25th. It is likely that the Tunisian protests spread to Egypt in a sort of revolutionary prairie fire [@Kuran:1989], occurring too rapidly for Mubarak to even consider making concessions to civil society. The statistical correlation between the CSRE and neighborhood instability might have occurred *after* Mubarak's resignation, but as explored in detail above, SCAF and Morsi were overwhelmingly concerned with domestic stability and regime cohesion. Unrest in Tunisia, Libya, Bahrain, and elsewhere in 2011 was thus unlikely to further destabilize the country—it had already been affected by the regional unrest and its new leaders were dealing with the consequences. Had Mubarak not left office in 2011 and a similar sudden rise in the CSRE occurred in the following year, the story that making concessions to civil society to protect against regional instability would be more convincing. As it stands now, though, regional instability and the CSRE are only correlated in 2011—there is most likely not a causal relationship. 

Thus, regional instability is clearly linked with changes in Egypt's CSRE, but for varying reasons. The second Palestinian Intifada helped encourage the passage of Law 84, which created vast discretionary authority that allowed Mubarak to carefully balance the popular desire to support Palestine against the threat of supporting domestic terror groups. The 2011 uprising preceded Egypt's largest ever improvement in the CSRE, but the connection is better explained with internal domestic politics. 

## Reputation

Finally, reputational concerns appear to have played a minimal role in shaping either Egypt's formal INGO-related legislation or its de facto civil society regulatory environment. @fig:timeline-egy demonstrates this—the country faced low levels of international shaming in the press until 2012–13, when Morsi's crackdown on protestors, the anti-Morsi coup, and the military's massacre of Muslim Brotherhood members drew international ire and condemnation. The drop in the CSRE correlates temporally with the increase in shaming, but when the shaming subsided following Morsi's abdication and Sisi's eventual rise to power, the CSRE did not rebound in turn. 

It is possible that preemptive shaming and unobservable diplomacy could have an effect on INGO regulations, but it is difficult to find evidence to support this. Wikileaks cables offer a glimpse into Egypt's reputational concerns. In August 2006, a delegation from the United States met with Egyptian government officials in a series of wide-ranging topics related to US foreign aid. During the meeting, the Egyptian Minister of Social Solidarity defended Law 84 and argued that the Egyptian government needed the law's powers to maintain a safe and healthy civil society regulatory environment. Distressed by the treatment of domestic and international NGOs in Egypt under Law 84 (and concerned with USAID's ability to partner with those NGOs when undertaking development projects), the National Security Council (NSC) Director for Democracy and Human Rights responded by requesting that the US be allowed to provide comments on the law, with the goal of "revising NGO legislation to bring it into compliance with international standards" [@06CAIRO5019a]. The US wielded its diplomatic power to attempt to influence NGO law reforms with an oblique reference to international reputation (i.e. appealing to the notion of compliance with international standards). However, no reforms ever took place under Mubarak, and NGO-related statutes did not receive any statutory updates until 2017. International reputation thus likely played little role in Egypt's NGO regulations.

![Timeline of de jure and de facto NGO regulations in Russia](../../Output/figures/2-timeline-rus){#fig:timeline-rus}



1995
As the international balance of power shifted away from Cold War two-superpower alignments in the early 1990s, non-state actors—guided in part by moralistic and capitalistic norms—gained significant prominence in global affairs [@Lipschutz:1992], and particularly so in newly democratizing Eastern Europe and Latin America [@Munck:2010]. Foreign foundations and private donors interested in democratization flooded Russia's nascent grassroots society organizations with aid in the early and mid-1990s, which provided hundreds of civil society organizations with valuable equipment and training and substantially increased their organizational capacity. This influx of foreign funds, however, changed the nature of domestic Russian NGOs and forged patron-client ties between international donors and Russian recipients, strengthening vertical ties between NGOs and foreign nations, rather than creating horizontal networks necessary for a more robust and socially responsive civil society sector. Instead of a strong grassroots civil society, foreign democratization aid in post-Soviet Russia helped created a "professionalized realm of NGOs, inaccessible to most local groups and compromised by its links to a neoliberal vision of development" [@Hemment:2004, 215].

In the first years of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, the Russian legal system was ill-equipped to handle this rush of foreign-backed grassroots civil society [@Henderson:2003]. The 1977 Soviet constitution contained provisions for creating social organizations to encourage education, sport, and culture, and the Communist party controlled and oversaw all state-approved organizations [@Albertie:2004]. With the collapse of the party and *ancien régime,* however, the new post-Soviet NGO sector was governed by outmoded laws that both stifled activists and prevented the government from controlling the sector. 

In the midst of this tumultuous political milieu, the Russian Duma passed the 1995 Law on Public Associations, providing a legal foundation for regulating civil society in modern Russia. The law regulated the relationship between the government and NGOs and outlined bureaucratic procedures for establishing and maintaining NGOs [@Albertie:2004]. Importantly, though the 1995 law was not specifically targeted at international NGOs, the new regulations allowed the government to regain control over Russian domestic civil society and limit foreign influence. The law forced the registration or re-registration of all domestic and international NGOs by 1999, and failing to register led to liquidation and closure. On its face, reregistration was intended to update administrative information and improve government efficiency, but "in effect, the re-registration provision operated to eliminate troublesome and undesirable organizations" [@Albertie:2004, 20], and in particular organizations funded by foreign sponsors that dealt with human rights issues.

Reregistration proved to be a difficult hurdle for many organizations. Government bureaucrats wielded discretionary power in deciding which NGOs would be allowed to register, and NGOs were denied official recognition because of arbitrary issues, such as submitting applications with too many pages or an incorrect font size [@Albertie:2004, 22]. Ultimately, the 1995 law dramatically reduced the size of Russian civil society, as seen in @fig:russia-reregistration-before-after [@Grishina:2000]. Thousands of public associations throughout the country, many flush with foreign funds, shuttered their doors and ceased their work. 

![Effect of 1999 registration requirement](../../Output/figures/russia_reregistration_before_after){#fig:russia-reregistration-before-after}

2006


Reprising his fear of NGOs from his first term, in just a few months following his second inauguration, Vladimir Putin signed the 2012 Foreign Agents Law, which contained a set of strict regulations aimed specifically at stigmatizing international NGOs and any domestic NGOs that receive funds from abroad. Similar to the original 1995 Law on Associations, the 2012 law required that any NGO that either (1) received funding from or was based in a foreign country, or (2) engaged in any form of "political activity" (broadly defined) had to reregister with the government as a иностранный агент, or "foreign agent", a legal term of art laden with powerful symbolic meaning—traitorous spies working against the Soviet regime during the Cold War received the same appellation.[^10] Beyond the registration requirement, the law also required that foreign-connected NGOs prominently advertise the fact that they were foreign agents on all publications, pamphlets, and marketing. Failing to disclose this status carried a fine of up to 500,000 rubles—roughly US $7,000 [@Flikke:2015, 9]. 

Since the law was implemented in 2012, Russian authorities have enforced it far more vigorously than previous NGO regulations, increasing spontaneous inspections and shuttering and harassing organizations that did not voluntarily register [@Flikke:2015, 10]. By 2015, a third of foreign-connected NGOs in Russia had shut down and left the country.[^11] Subsequent regulations passed in 2014 sought to co-opt international NGOs, as Putin restored and transformed the Public Chamber as the primary domestic source for NGO funding, thereby attempting to dissuade domestic organizations from linking with foreign powers.

Most recently, the Duma (under Putin's influence) passed a set of amendments to the 2012 law—the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law, which allowed the government to blacklist any foreign-connected NGO that it considered exceptionally undesirable. Prominent Western INGOs such as the Open Society Foundations (OSF), the MacArthur Foundation, Freedom House, Amnesty International, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) were all deemed undesirable and subsequently expelled from the country.[^12]

## Internal risk

Post-Soviet stuff


Internally, Yeltsin's early years were volatile and tumultuous. In the final months of 1994, internal political instability dropped to one of its lowest points, following months of high inflation rates, IMF-backed economic shock therapy, intra-regime conflict, and persistent constitutional crises. Most threatening to the regime's stability, however, was the direct threat of the Chechnya separatist movement, which had fomented since 1992. Yeltsin ordered an invasion of Chechnya in December 1994, launching a two-year civil war that would eventually end in stalemate. 




As seen in @fig:timeline-rus, the 1999 registration deadline marked the start of the decline in Russia's civil society regulatory environment. By 1999, external threats had largely ceased—the subregion has had a "low" risk rating from ICRG from the late 1990s until today. Internally, political instability had improved during the mid 1990s, but dropped to its lowest point in post-Soviet history, receiving a "very high" risk rating beginning in late 1998. 


2006 law

Following the inauguration of Vladimir Putin in 2000, the general civil society regulatory environment steadily worsened as the new president worked to consolidate his power. Putin sought more direct control over the country's political institutions. In 2002, he ended elections for regional governors and gave himself the power to directly appoint regional officials, and thereby indirectly appoint their local legislative and judicial subordinates. Putin also took control of the country's last independent television network, threatened journalists (and allegedly assassinated the most vocal), and cajoled the country's rich oligarchs into cooperating with the regime [@Blitt:2008]. 

For Putin, it appears that domestic and international NGOs were yet another institution that needed to be controlled. From 2000–2005, Russia's CSRE steadily worsened as internal stability increased, contrary to both hypothesis 1 and the statistical findings. NGO-based power consolidation culminated in Federal Law No. 18-FZ, enacted in January 2006. This new law imposed dozens of additional registration requirements for NGOs and granted government bureaucrats additional discretionary powers to permit or deny legal status to NGOs. Most importantly, however, the law contained a bevy of restrictions targeted specifically at both international and foreign-backed domestic NGOs. 

Bureaucrats were empowered to deny registration to any foreign NGO if its "goals and objectives … create a threat to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, national unity, unique character, cultural heritage, and national interests of the Russian Federation" [@icnl-russia:2006, 2]. Additionally, the government gained new supervisory powers and required that NGOs provide details of all foreign funds, allow bureaucrats to observe or participate in any public or private event or meeting held by the organization, and ultimately determine whether an NGOs programming is appropriate and nonthreatening. The law also restricted foreign nationals, preventing anyone not legally residing in Russia from being a founder, member, or participant in any NGO [@Maxwell:2006]. As with the 1995 law, miscellaneous minutia placed burdens on foreign NGOs and often led to the revocation of their legal status—for example, the new law required that all registration materials had to be translated into Russian and certified by the government, but officials would often reject these certified translations, claiming they were "repulsive" and done poorly, forcing INGOs to pay for multiple translations [@Blitt:2008, 36]. 

According my hypothesis, the 2006 restrictions imposed on INGOs were unlikely. Putin passed the law at the height of his political consolidation, and the country was the most internally stable it had been since before the fall of the Soviet Union. Internal political risk improved steadily during Putin's first presidential tenure, though apparently at the expense of civil society, as the CSRE declined in concert with Russia's growing stability. External political risk was also extremely low, as Eastern Europe continued to be considered quite stable in spite of the ongoing second civil war in Chechnya. Inter-state condemnation and shaming of Putin began to rise in 2005 and 2006, but still remained relatively low. What, then, led to the additional restrictions?



Medvedev

In 2008, Dmitry Medvedev succeeded Putin as president, inheriting the former ruler's formidable consolidated political scene (and benefitting from Putin's support behind the scenes as prime minister). Instead of continuing Putin's more authoritarian consolidation, Medvedev engaged in some forms of liberalization and openness, and in November 2008, he offered NGOs an olive branch in his inauguration speech, calling for closer and more amiable cooperation between the government and civil society sector [@Flikke:2015, 5]. Medvedev met with NGO leaders in 2009 and promised to review the 2006 NGO law, ultimately passing several amendments to ease some of the strictest regulations, in particular not allowing bureaucrats to deny registration to organizations that threatened Russia's cultural heritage or national interests [@Jenkins:2012, 506–7]. 

However, this newfound openness did not last long. The Medvedev regime's internal political risk began to drop immediately upon taking office, and by 2010, discretionary and targeted restrictions on Western-related NGOs increased, leading to a new decrease in the overall regulatory environment for civil society. Contrary to the years of Putin's political consolidation, the CSRE and internal stability moved in lock step, as hypothesized—as stability worsens, so too do the restrictions on NGOs. 

---- 

Putin again, with gosudarstvenost

Fear of external interference (but not necessarily coups)

Given the internal political context, as well as persistent external threats to stability, Russia's rapid crackdown on the environment for foreign civil society organizations is not unexpected. By the time Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, Russia's internal political risk had fallen to its worst level since the first few years of Putin's first term. A confluence of economic and political factors stoked this internal instability, including a flagging economy, Putin's ambitions to expand Russian influence into the Middle East and China, and a latent interest in irredentism (which would come to full fruition with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014). 

## External threats

Post-Soviet stuff
External threats to the regime also loomed large. Political risk throughout the Eastern European subregion mirrored Russia's own internal crisis, as the ICRG categorized the region with "very high" risk. The threat of uprisings, coups, and revolutions in the Balkans, Czechoslovakia, and other former Soviet republics, added to the already intensely risky political climate. 
Refer to the chart?

2006 law

Measurement error likely hides the overriding explanatory factor for these new restrictions. Three prominent Eastern European political revolutions—the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, the 2004–2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan—are not reflected in the regional or subregional risk score. In each of these revolutions, thousands of protestors took to the streets in mass demonstrations that eventually led the overthrow of each ruling regime. Both international NGOs and Western-supported domestic NGOs played a critical role in each color revolution. As in Russia, backed by millions of dollars in democracy assistance aid, global civil society had established itself as a powerful institution in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, but unlike Russia, none of these states had curbed the influence of the sector to the same extent. Subsequently, Western NGOs and civil society groups provided material support to aggrieved protestors and helped shape post-revolutionary governments [@Tudoroiu:2007].

Given their role in the color revolutions, Putin and his administration were concerned with the potential destabilizing influence of international NGOs, and the 2006 law appears to have been drafted explicitly to prevent and stave off revolutionary contagion from the region [@Machleder:2006]. Developments after the 2006 law provide some evidence for Russian fears of contagion. In an effort to realign domestic NGOs with Russia, rather than Western foundations and INGOs, Putin attempted to make the state the "primary financier" of the NGO sector [@CrottyHallLjubownikow:2014], thus heading off potential external influence. The government established the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, a bureaucratic body responsible for doling out all federal funding to NGOs through competitive grants [@Richter:2009]. In theory, the Chamber would have allowed the state to sever the financial ties between NGOs and Western organizations, but ultimately, the Chamber has been wildly inefficient—in 2010, the Chamber awarded one billion rubles to 604 of Russia's 300,000 NGOs [@LjubownikowCrotty:2014, 766], and it has been widely criticized for its corruption [@Richter:2009].


As with the color revolutions preceding Russia's 2006 INGO law, the statistical model again fails to account for external instability and fears of contagion. In 2012, uprisings and revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, and others threatened authoritarian regimes worldwide, especially as the revolutionary spark appeared to spread throughout the region. Syria, in particular, posed a threat to Putin's international ambitions, as Syrian president Bashar al-Assad acted as Russia's regional client and openly received Russian support to fend off the revolutionary movement (ultimately launching the country into a still ongoing civil war). 

In parallel with 2006, fears of foreign meddling appear to be the overriding factor for the 2012 and 2015 laws. The architects of the 2015 Undesirable Organizations law revealed as much. Konstantin Kosachev, the chair of the committee responsible for labeling INGOs as "undesirable," argued in 2015 that

> The scale of the foreign NGOs’ activities in Russia is of a destructive nature and their aim is to overthrow the authorities in Russia. … Their main task is to try and make a direct impact on Russia’s internal political processes, intervene in them and in the long run ensure that a regime that is more loyal to these states (that finance the NGOs in Russia) come[s] to power [@Hamlett:2015, 7].

One of the law's cosponsors, Aleksandr Tarnavsky, linked the harshness of the new INGO restrictions with the external threats of foreign meddling in Ukraine, stating that

> Events in Ukraine have offended me, like many other Russians. Western countries audaciously spoke to us of friendship, while their secret services staged a coup hoping to tear Ukraine away from us. You act like that to us, then we’ll treat you the same. It’s pure pragmatism—nothing personal.[^13]

Tarnavsky argued that the strict regulations would loom large for INGOs, like a "weapon hanging on the wall and that never fires,"[^14] forcing them to toe the government line. The law was thus conceived of as a sort of defensive weapon against undue foreign influence, necessitated by ongoing fears of external instability.

## Reputational concerns

Putin 2012

Interstate shaming of Russia increased substantially following Putin's inauguration and subsequent crackdown on civil society, though much of the international condemnation was not directly related to the regime's treatment of INGOs—rather, Western countries tended to rail against Putin's recalcitrance and newfound position as an authoritarian bogeyman. (EVIDENCE FOR THIS TODO)

Russia is a prime case for studying authoritarian restrictions on international NGOs. Though it is not formally defined as an autocracy (as its Polity IV score ranges between 0–6 since 1991), Russia—especially under the rule of Vladimir Putin—has long been accused of harboring authoritarian tendencies by both right- and left-leaning media and scholars.[^15] Post-Soviet Russia was also a proving ground for an emerging global civil society, and as thousands of Western funded NGOs began operations in the 1990s, tensions between domestic state sovereignty, foreign states, and international non-state actors boiled up, leading directly to a series of laws strategically tailored to curb international influence in Russia's domestic affairs. In this brief case study, I trace the development of Russia's regulatory environment for international and foreign-based NGOs since 1990, connecting key legislative restrictions with the most prominent internal, external, and reputational factors from the statistical models (see @fig:timeline-rus).

## Domestic and global civil society in post-Soviet Russia

The events surrounding the 1995 Law on Associations generally support my theory. Internal political instability, driven in particular by an unregulated foreign-backed NGO sector, civil war, and domestic constitutional drama, appears to have helped set the stage for restrictive regulations that could be used discretionarily against foreign NGOs. More instability thus led to a worse legal environment. External regional threats and fears of contagion also likely influenced the legislation, contrary to the statistical findings. Finally, there is little evidence that shaming influenced INGO regulations during the 1990s.

## Vladimir Putin, part one: power consolidation and fears of contagion

Thus, the 2006 NGO law provides mixed evidence to support my hypotheses. As internal regime stability increased and Putin consolidated his power, the civil society regulatory environment worsened, contrary to the first hypothesis. External and reputational factors, as measured in the statistical model, have no apparent effect on the decision to pass the law, but unmeasured external factors—the threat of color revolution contagion—*did* have a demonstrably powerful effect on the legal environment and were likely the crucial factor for limiting INGOs in Russia. 

## Vladimir Putin, part two: regional ambitions and new fears of contagion

Though data for the CSRE is only available through 2012, two important and highly restrictive pieces of legislation passed in 2012 and 2015 which have undoubtedly further diminished the index. All three hypothesized mechanisms appear to play a role in this most recent push to regulate and restrict international NGOs working in Russia. 

Events leading to the 2012 Foreign Agents and 2015 Undesirable Organizations laws provide moderate evidence for my hypotheses. As internal political stability decreased (especially in response to Putin's irredentist annexation of Crimea and subsequent war with Ukraine) and threats of revolutionary contagion and external political stability increased, civil society restrictions intensified correspondingly, as anticipated. However, the regime was apparently not responsive to international shaming and condemnation.


# China: reputation and regularity


Egypt and Russian both enshrine regime preferences in rare-ish laws and use tons of discretion in applying the laws - lets them be highly responsive to domestic pressures, threats to regime cohesion and stability, and threats from abroad. Gives them flexibility too - they can target both domestic and international NGOs as needed. Law 84 (and now law whatever) allows Egypt to shut down local human rights NGOs *and* large international NGOs like Amnesty and IRI. Russia's 2012 and 2015 laws are wielded similarly—Putin can use them to shut down local NGOs, kick out international NGOs like Amnesty, OSF, IRI

[^16] + other laws, like protests laws, the penal code - discretion allowed regime to use civil society to maintain stability + stop NGOs that got too unruly - Egypt had little change in formal legislation between 2002 and 2017 because the 2002 law allowed for a lot of discretion - (2012 version of ICNL monitor says "Law 84 of 2002 is not so much restrictive as it is discretionary. Law 84 of 2002 gives enormous discretionary powers to the Ministry of Social Solidarity.")

China unique - highly regularized legal framework for NGOs. Only country of the three to have a law dedicated solely to international NGOs and foundations - some discretion is allowed, as we'll see, but not as much—INGOs have to follow rules and can't hide as much

Fewer concessions are made

Mark Sidel: 

> Not all NGOs are created equal: The state could treat all environmental public interest groups the same, or treat all disability rights groups the same – but it doesn't, and that's very interesting. So a complex situation gets even more complex, as the state allows space for some advocacy groups, while not for others [@Leach:2014]

> Law is not just a legal matter - it's a political signal - fear isn't about the precise legality - you can still get around the law - domestic NGOs can still register as businesses, deal with tax issues, accounting, reporting issues - INGOs have been more flexible in partnering with domestic - but it's trickier to do that now since the government is signaling its hostility towards that happening [^17]

Visible in the country's CSRE over time, which is lower than either Egypt or Russia

The case of China shows the importance of reputation + fears of domestic instability and foreign influence - not so much threats from instability abroad

HIV/AIDS, disability rights, urban renewal, environmental NGOs appear to be "good" NGOs in China

![Timeline of de jure and de facto NGO regulations in China](../../Output/figures/2-timeline-chn){#fig:timeline-chn}

That doesn't mean they don't care about domestic instability - the internet is highly regulated and censored

In China, NGOs have been "caught up in the larger struggle… to craft a stronger party and a stronger China" [@icnl-china]


## Internal stability

> Outside observers see Chinese government as stable - that's a misperception - they have strong control over the media - no coverage of protests, which happen all the time - hundreds every day(!) - March 2013 came in power, has sense of crisis of the CCCP to hold power - worried that party is losing touch with ordinary people - instituted controls on corruption, also civil society, bringing it inline with party policies - anyone threatening party power is hostile, human rights or not - so there *are* internal threats, but we can't observe it - but there is paranoia - [^18]

Like Egypt, reshaping CS to be more like the government

> These developments constitute a top-down effort by the party-state to mold a “civil society” in its own image - the party would actually prefer to use a term like “social sector” or “people’s society” - that does not have a strong value preference for what the government perceives as Western-style individual freedoms and rights. These efforts to remake China’s civil society are reflected in the roll out of the Charity Law, the Overseas NGO Law, and important accompanying regulations all in 2016. This regulatory “Great Leap Forward” constitutes arguably the biggest legislative development in the history of the nonprofit sector in the PRC.


New foreign NGO law is a way to finally regularize relations with international NGOs


New law puts organizations in incredibly close alignment with the regime - PSUs

Main obstacle for INGOs working in China is the need to be officially sponsored by a Professional Supervisory Agency (PSU) before registering with the Ministry of Public Safety. Local government partners are unwilling to become PSUs because of political risk for individual careers and agency reputation

No clarity about which agencies can count as PSUs - how to handle cross sectoral organizations that span multiple potential PSUs

Unclear what “political activities” means


Law requires INGOs to hire local accountants and staff, but smaller organizations can’t afford it. "The burden placed on such small groups is quite great and may result in an outflow of groups that do small but meaningful work in China"

China - few domestic tensions (apart from Tibet + Uighurs), party is stable since the late 2000s -

## External risk

Instability from neighbors not much of an issue - few coups, few protests abroad

> There is some external threat - worried about western espionage - South China Sea - Western plots against China - nationalism - hard to tell if that's true [^19]

Influence from abroad is a concern, but not because of revolutionary contagion - more like social, education, political contagion

Chinese NGO leaders are educated abroad and remain involved in issue area networks - "By socializing Chinese NGO activists, global civil society has shaped the development of the third sector in China" [@Wang:2012, 109]

## Reputation

China cares about international reputation to a point - Olympics in 2008

Reputation in @Wang:2012, 113 - China more careful when dealing with foreign NGOs because of concerns over China's international image - government tolerates foreign NGOs, tacitly allows them to work - some INGOs aren't registered, some are registered as for-profit organizations, some are affiliated with universities - see also @HsiaWhite:2002 

# Conclusion

Benefits to combining LNA and SNA. Small details and nuances of the individual cases obscure trends in the statistical model - like Egypt's external threats. The model missed the effects of the Second Intifada in Palestine, which encouraged the development of Law 84 of 2002 and gave Mubarak extraordinary discretionary power in dealing with NGOs, and the model overstated the effect of the Arab Spring on Egypt's spontaneously improved CSRE in 2011–2012. While unrest did indeed precede the expansion of civil society, it is highly unlikely that it played a direct causal role—SCAF and Morsi expanded and contracted the space for civil society largely in reaction to internal political crises and challenges to regime cohesion, not because they feared a spillover of protests from Tunisia or Libya.



Compare Egypt, China, and Russia - similarities in how/why they regulate INGOs

- China: reputation/internal
- Egypt: internal/external
- Russia: internal/external

So what?

but that the issue was "'not urgent' like the revisions to the 
election law or the new anti-terror law

Return to each hypothesis, since the SNA should reinforce LNA
