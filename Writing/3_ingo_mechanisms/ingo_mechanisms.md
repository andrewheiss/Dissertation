As explained in the previous chapter, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), foreign foundations, private donors, and scholars of international affairs flooded Russia with aid and technical assistance. Among the most prominent early foreign entrants into the country's nascent civil society and political sectors were the Open Society Foundations (OSF), a philanthropic advocacy organization funded by American billionaire George Soros, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace—America's "oldest international affairs think tank"[^1]—which created the Carnegie Moscow Center as a regional research hub. Throughout Russia's tumultuous post-Soviet history, OSF and the Carnegie Center were influential proponents of political liberalization and democratization. The two organizations pursued different strategies—OSF funded and supported domestic NGOs working on issues of education, freedom of expression, and human rights, while the Carnegie Center supported scholars and foreign policy experts in Russia and abroad, funding and disseminating white papers, reports, and general research and advocacy for Eastern European liberalization—but the two shared the same fundamental goal of improving human rights and the rule of law in Russia and the region.

In December 2015, after more than two decades of advocacy in the country, OSF was forced to cease all operations in Russia, terminate all its ongoing programs, and stop funding local Russian NGOs. While the Carnegie Center continues its research in Moscow today, OSF had been deemed an "undesirable organization" earlier that year—a legal designation created by the eponymous 2015 law passed by the Putin administration, allowing the government to blacklist and expel any organization it felt was too dangerous and threatening. OSF's expulsion in 2015 was the culmination of years of heavy legal restrictions on international NGO activities, which started in earnest with the 2012 Foreign Agents law aimed at domestic human rights NGOs. The government's initial list of undesirable organizations included just five international NGOs: Human Rights Watch, Memorial, Amnesty International, OSF, and the Carnegie Moscow Center, but by the second draft of the list, the Carnegie Center had been removed and spared the chopping block.[^2] Today, OSF does not support any NGOs in Russia or engage in any direct advocacy in the country. The Carnegie Center, on the other hand, continues to hold conferences, publish white papers, and advise government officials.

For decades, OSF and the Carnegie Center had shared similar experiences with harsh legal restrictions in Russia, but in 2015, the two organizations diverged dramatically. Why was one forced to leave the country while the other remained and continued its work?

According to a high-level OSF program officer, a crucial factor for deciding to support NGOs in a country is the safety of the activists and organizations they support. If the Foundations' support of an organization leads to jail time, harassment, or otherwise impairs or imperils those they support, they withdraw or halt that support. OSF has a clear, calculated, and rational vision for how it operates. The decision to stay or leave a country is based primarily on how well the organization's work promotes change. If OSF can no longer make satisfactory change, whether because of the legal environment, local political developments, cultural shifts, wars, revolutions, or any other external factor that influences their ability to affect change and reform, the organization reaches a tipping point where "the jig is up" and they withdraw and move their resources elsewhere. OSF is motivated by cost-benefit utility function that determines how they allocate their programming and funding. Through their "judicious calculus," the foundation works to balance the need to affect satisfactory change against the injunction to "do no harm" and need to guarantee the safety of their partners. Pragmatism drives their organizational decisions.[^3]

In contrast, the Carnegie Center was motivated by a different set of core principles and values. Because the organization has historically produced detailed research on international and regional political affairs, it has long prized its cozy access to Russian government officials. As Putin's regime began to crack down on INGOs in 2012, the Center adjusted its strategy and programming to remain in the country. Three of its most outspoken liberal researchers and activists were let go between 2012–2014, replaced with research fellows more friendly to Putin. Few of the Center's public events since 2012 have discussed internal Russian politics or Putin's push to become a stronger regional power—as Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the Center generally remained silent [@Kirchick:2015]. The Carnegie Center's desire to remain in the country drove its organizational decisions, but at the cost of potentially compromising its reputation and reducing the value of its programming. 

This sharp divergence between OSF and the Carnegie Center illustrates a broader trend occurring on a global scale. Since the 1990s, INGOs have emerged as a cornerstone of global governance [@Lipschutz:1992; @AhmedPotter:2006] and have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes. Autocrats, in response to internal, external, and reputational pressures, work to regulate and restrict the activities and programming of international and foreign-funded NGOs working their countries. These regulations and restrictions often force INGOs to make difficult organizational decisions. What determines when INGOs comply with legal restrictions (like the Carnegie Center), resist government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely (like OSF)? Why do INGOs work in these regimes if their services and advocacy could potentially help the regime? More generally, how do INGOs adapt to their institutional context and what tactics do they use to stay in engaged in the countries they target? 

To answer these questions, I shift the argument away from determining *why* autocrats regulate international NGOs and look instead at *how* the political, legal, and regulatory institutions of the countries INGOs work in affect these organizations' strategies and programming. In this chapter, I use evidence from a global survey of international NGOs to operationalize and define each INGO-related element of the theory of amicable contempt. I find that INGOs are primarily motivated by their core vision and values, but that they have to balance the pursuit of their missions with instrumental concerns such as fundraising, time, staffing, and collaboration. These concerns both limit and enable INGO activities—without instrumental flexibility, organizations are unable to carry out their mission, while too much emphasis on resource concerns distracts organizations from their core programming and reduces their effectiveness. 

Amidst this internal struggle between mission and money, I then introduce how the civil society regulatory environment of INGO host countries is designed to target each element of this struggle. Gatekeeping regulations limit which organizations are allowed to enter the country and constrain the flexibility of organizations already present in the country. These regulations are primarily defensive and are designed to protect the regime against the potentially destabilizing effects of INGO advocacy and service provision. Program capture regulations, on the other hand, are more offensive and target organizational missions instead of their flexibility. These laws are designed to co-opt and reshape INGO programming to fall more in line with government preferences, allowing regimes to take advantage of INGO activities. In the two chapters that follow, I combine survey data with case studies of (1) Article 19 and AMERA International to examine how INGOs draw on their flexibility to respond and adapt to gatekeeping regulations and (2) Index on Censorship and the International Republican Institute (IRI) to examine responses to regulations designed to capture, change, and take advantage of NGO missions. 


# Data and methods: a global survey of international NGOs

Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on the relationship between authoritarian regimes and *domestic* institutions like civil society [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014; @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @FrantzEzrow:2011], as well as detailed case studies of individual authoritarian regimes [@Blaydes:2011; @Chen:2012; @Weiss:2013; @Teets:2014; @Hildebrandt:2013; @Brownlee:2007], and autocracies in general [@LevitskyWay:2010]. However, beyond newer case study work [@Teets:2014], little research has looked at how authoritarian regimes and *international* nongovernmental institutions interact.

Additionally, there is a dearth of structured data on INGO activities or behavior. These organizations publish a wealth of unstructured data, such as annual reports, budgets, press releases, or calls to advocacy, but few have systematically compiled these data sources into usable datasets. Existing research either relies on event data parsed from large corpora of news reports or highly specific in-depth case studies based on interviews and other unstructured data. Each of these approaches, however, pose methodological challenges. Event data often yields weak or uninteresting results since event data algorithms were originally developed to track wars and interactions between global elites—not NGOs—while case studies tend to be too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013; @MitchellSchmitz:2014]. For example, human rights INGO research has thus far been primarily concerned with Amnesty International and other similar organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, or Oxfam [@Stroup:2012; @Wong:2012]. While there is utility in amassing thick descriptions of INGO activities, more must be done. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 argue that INGO case studies need to be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work on specific issue areas as a whole. To this end, I test my theory of INGO behavior by conducting an online global survey of international NGOs that work in authoritarian regimes.[^4]

Complete technical details of the survey are provided in the dissertation's appendix. I define an INGO as any organization that is not incorporated as a governmental entity or as a profit-seeking private firm that conducts advocacy, provides services, or otherwise works in at least *one* country other than the one it is headquartered in.[^5] Of the 17,590 organizations that potentially received an e-mail invitation to participate in the online survey, 537 completed the survey and 104 provided a partial (but usable) response. This yielded a participation rate of 3.8%, which is admittedly low, but similar to that found in other internet-based organizational surveys [@BaruchHoltom:2008]. Survey questions were divided into two general sections related to (1) individual organizations and (2) the countries that organizations target. Respondents were allowed to answer country-specific questions for multiple countries, but only eighteen did so, thus yielding 641 organization-level responses and 659 country-level responses. The survey included 36 open-ended questions, and most respondents answered between 8–16, providing a wealth of qualitative insights into INGO experiences with their host governments. To give voice to these organizations, I quote extensively from these responses with minimal editing or correction. I guaranteed respondents anonymity to encourage candor in responses and to protect privacy. Accordingly, I assign each respondent a random four-digit ID number, and I strip all potentially identifying information from excerpts and quotes from their responses. I also anonymize any country-specific information, replacing references to country names with general regions (e.g. Ghana is reported as West Africa; Thailand is reported as Southeast Asia).

Those who filled out the survey were quite familiar with their organizations' work and had an intimate perspective of their organizations' experiences and strategies. More than half of the respondents indicated that they were the executive director, president, secretary general, CEO, or other high-level officer for their organization, and roughly a third were staff members or program officers, with the remainder either public relations officers or receptionists. Responding organizations span the globe and work on a wide variety of issues and policies. The sample of INGOs have their headquarters spread across 93 different countries (see @fig:hq-countries), with roughly two thirds based in either Europe or the Americas, primarily in the US, UK, and Switzerland (see left panel of @fig:work-hq-regions). 

![Countries where INGOs are headquartered](../../Output/figures/3-hq-countries){#fig:hq-countries}

![Regions where INGOs are headquartered vs. regions about which INGOs answered questions](../../Output/figures/3-work-hq-regions){#fig:work-hq-regions}

While comparatively few INGOs are headquartered outside the Global North, these organizations have a worldwide reach. As described previously, the survey asked respondents to select all the countries they work in and then allowed respondents to answer questions about their work in at least one. Though 20% of responding organizations indicated working only in one other country, the median number of countries was 6, with a mean of 16 (see @fig:countries-per-response in the appendix). In total, INGOs selected 169 different countries and answered questions about their work in 148. The regional distribution of INGO target countries reflects their broader scope and is almost a mirror image of these organizations' home regions—nearly two-thirds of respondents answered questions about their work in Africa and Asia (see right panel of @fig:work-hq-regions), the most underrepresented regions for NGO headquarters. This disparity could reflect the fact that INGOs from the Global South without a clear English-language internet presence were excluded from the sample, but the pattern also corresponds to similar findings in other surveys of global NGOs [@Limoncelli:2016; @HeissKelley:2016; @FootToftCesare:2015], reinforcing the idea that Northern-based NGOs tend to focus their work in the South. Organizations also operate in a variety of political contexts. Unsurprisingly, given the concentration of INGOs in the Global North, the vast majority of respondents (90%) are headquartered in democracies. The countries these organizations work in, though, show more diversity in regime type—a third of respondents (219) answered questions about their work in autocratic regimes.


# Framework mechanisms

Multiple mechanisms explain an INGO's response to government regulations, each of which correspond to an element in the bargaining model of amicable contempt. Below, I map the experiences of survey respondents onto each INGO-related element of the model. I explore the tensions between core organizational principles and instrumental constraints and introduce the concept of instrumental flexibility, expanding work done by @MitchellSchmitz:2014 and other nonprofit management scholars. I also consider the overlap between organizational instrumental flexibility and a regime's regulatory environment, which constitutes the practical operating environment that INGOs must work within. 

## Core mission

An organization's foundational mission, vision, and values are represented by the ideal point in the model (see @fig:theory-ngo-dot). What exactly these values are, though, has been the subject of a decades-long debate over the role of NGOs in global politics. International NGOs were initially seen as a "magic bullet" for global governance: highly principled voluntary organizations that promoted human rights, alleviated poverty, provided needed services following disasters, and generally behaved altruistically under the leadership of well-intentioned mangers [@Reimann:2005; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @NyeKeohane:1971; @Bartelson:2006]. This overly normative conceptualization of INGO motives was called into question in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with research critiquing INGOs' lack of public accountability, potential for corruption, dependence on the financial support of governments they were designed to criticize, and emphasis on pursuing funding over mission [@HulmeEdwards:1997a; @HulmeEdwards:1997b; @Marzouk:1997; @BanksHulmeEdwards:2015; @Reimann:2005]. 

![INGO ideal point: core organizational mission, vision, and values](../../Graphics/theory-ngo-dot){#fig:theory-ngo-dot}

Building on these critiques, a new trend emerged that treated transnational actors as simultaneously normative and strategic [@Cooley:2002; @Keck:1999; @Kelley:2009a]. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 summarized this debate with their theory of nonprofit principled instrumentalism, or the notion that INGOs must balance their normative mission-driven principles against the instrumental needs of organizational survival. Unlike governments that work toward producing social value (such as maximizing national security or promoting general welfare) and unlike firms that focus on financial performance (such as maximizing profits for shareholders), nonprofit organizations face a tradeoff between their social mission and their need for resources and must pursue both concurrently—they must "instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. 

INGOs are motivated primarily by their foundational mission and values, and they structure their strategies around this vision to ensure that their programming furthers their mission [@Moore:2000]. In their landmark study of transnational NGO leadership, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 find evidence that organizations tend to focus principally on their core missions, and that concerns with money, fundraising, and other overhead, instrumental concerns are secondary. In response to the question "In general, what would you say your organization is trying to accomplish?," only a quarter of transnational NGO leaders in Mitchell and Schmitz's study mentioned fundraising as a core organizational strategy, with the majority emphasizing their advocacy, service delivery, capacity building or research goals. I find a similar trend in my own survey. In response to the same question about organizational goals, no respondents identified their core mission as resource-oriented. Respondents described their core mission both in aspirational terms, including "fighting poverty and holding leaders accountable,"[^6] encouraging "awareness and pro-action towards sustainable development,"[^7] and promoting "democracy and open society" and "governments' respect for the human rights of children";[^8] and through more specific statements, such as "improv[ing] healthcare, specifically neurological services, in the least developed nations,"[^9] or ending "the use of immigration detention around the world."[^10] Respondents categorized their missions within several broad issues (see @fig:issues-worked-on). The top three issues—education, development, and human rights—account for more than 60% of the respondents and reflect the makeup of the sample of organizations collected in my database. The remaining 40% of organizations focus on topics that reflect other common issues addressed by global civil society, such as public health, environmental advocacy, disaster relief, human trafficking, post-conflict resolution, and cultural promotion. 

The menu of programming INGOs provide generally aligns closely with their missions. Most respondents report a tight link between programs and missions, stating that "[o]ur mission, values and vision are reflected in everything that we do," that "all our work is geared towards the accomplishment of this objective," and that "our approach matches our mission precisely."[^11] For many organizations, the "mission and values are the reason we work on these objectives"[^12]—the normative goals of the organization provide strong motivation to engage in pro-social advocacy and services. Specific programming strategies are also closely linked to INGO missions. For instance, an organization working in South Asia has ambitions to "[b]uild the capacity of local organisations to equip adolescent girls to access their rights and address gender inequality through sport." As expected, much of their programming is centered on sports education and leadership training, but importantly, the organization makes a point that nothing they do is implemented directly: because their core mission is to build local capacity, they ensure that "all the work we do is through local organisations."[^13] Organizations thus work to ensure that their strategies align with and reflect their core missions, visions, and values.

## Ideal point distance and contentiousness

The distance between the government's preferences for a given issue and an INGO's core vision for that issue determine how contentious their relationship will be, ranging from cooperative to antagonistic (see @fig:theory-dot-distance). This distance, in turn, influences how governments attempt to regulate and oversee INGO work. The alignment of organizational missions and strategies with government preferences, therefore, is crucial for understanding government regulation of INGOs. Organizations working on issues that in line with regime preferences will be treated more favorably and with less regulatory pressure than INGOs working on more threatening, less aligned issues.

![Distance between regime and INGO ideal points: contentiousness of relationship](../../Graphics/theory-dot-distance){#fig:theory-dot-distance}

To analyze the favorability of INGO programming to government preferences, I divide the self-reported respondent issues into two levels of potential high or low regime contentiousness based on the potential compatibility of the issue with domestic politics in the host regime. In her work on democracy assistance NGOs, @Bush:2015 categorizes NGO programs according to their regime compatibility—activities that are highly regime compatible are those that "the target-country leaders view as unlikely to threaten their imminent survival by causing regime collapse or overthrow," as opposed to non-regime compatible programs that pose a more imminent threat [@Bush:2015, 60]. I follow a similar—though broader—definition when coding INGO contentiousness. While Bush accounts for the immediate political threat of democracy promotion NGO programming, I consider how regimes view NGO programming in the long run and how those activities fit into authoritarian calculations of stability. I code programming as highly contentious if it potentially targets government activities that are core to regime survival, thus posing a direct threat to autocratic policies and stability. As seen in @fig:issues-worked-on, highly contentious issues include human rights, advocacy, human trafficking, freedom of expression, conflict, and democracy assistance. Programming that aims to promote democracy, reduce government oppression, elevate anti-regime voices, or criticize human rights abuses has the potential to disrupt the balance of institutional actors described in previous chapters. 

![Issues INGOs work on the most, divided by potential contentiousness](../../Output/figures/3-issues-worked-on){#fig:issues-worked-on}

These highly contentious issues contrast with less contentious topics like education, development, health, and the environment. Governments are more willing to accept intervention and assistance in these areas because doing so poses less of a direct threat to regime stability and institutional balance. Providing a public platform for opposition leaders can empower rival institutions; digging wells typically does not. It is easier for a repressive government to improve its domestic reputation and offset institutional challenges to its political stability by embracing relief organizations, permitting community sport organizations, or partnering with health and environment INGOs. 

![Frequency of INGO engagement in different types of activities; organizations answered about one or more activities](../../Output/figures/3-main-activities){#fig:main-activities}

This division of INGOs into contentious and non-contentious programming aligns well with the activities INGOs report engaging in. @fig:main-activities shows how frequently responding organizations work on various types of programming.[^14] If the division of contentiousness is correct, low contention INGOs should provide direct aid and services and engage in research and public education most frequently, since these types of programming pose little threat to the target country regime. High contention INGOs, on the other hand, should deal most often with more threatening activities like advocacy, political mobilization, and government monitoring. There are substantial differences in how frequently high and low contention organizations engage in these types of activities. High contention INGOs are more likely to report always engaging in advocacy, monitoring governments, and mobilizing people than their low contention counterparts, which tend to always provide direct aid.[^15] As seen in the figure, 60% of low contention organizations indicated they almost always provide aid, half almost always engage in research, and less than 40% monitor the government or mobilize people. Interestingly, about half of low contention organizations reported regularly engaging in advocacy. However, this form of advocacy appears to still be non-contentious: respondents describe advocating for "expanded public health programs,"[^16] "agr[i]culture,"[^17] "volunteerism,"[^18] "girls completing secondary education,"[^19] or expanding "access [to] health and justice."[^20]

As expected, high contention organizations are most likely to report always engaging in advocacy (63%) and monitoring government policies (53%), including advocating for the recognition and safety of human rights defenders,[^21]assisting with the "rehabilitation of repentant terrorists,"[^22] promoting religious freedom and human rights, [^23] and "holding … leaders accountable" for their policies and actions.[^24] In aggregate, these more contentious organizations engage in research and public education as the third most common primary activity (53%). The educational activities respondents describe clearly pose more of a threat to the government and are more focused on human rights, such as maintaining a death penalty policy database,[^25] organizing activist training sessions and hackathons,[^26] or developing country-specific media literacy training programs.[^27] These organizations only sometimes provide direct aid and services, in contrast to their low contention counterparts. Finally, both kinds of INGOS are least likely to report always engaging in political mobilization, which is understandable for low contention organizations but surprising for those working on more contentious issues. INGOs may have conflated this kind of work with engaging in research—organizations mentioned political mobilization and campaigns in many of their explanations of their research and public education work.

This categorization is by no means perfect. As seen in the case of China in the previous chapter, education INGOs can pose a threat to regime stability as governments fear the spread of foreign influence among their youth, and development INGOs can rival weak central governments and create territorial "fiefdoms" to supersede the regime [@Schuller:2012]. However, while the division between low and high contention issues is fairly simplistic, it does appear to accurately capture (1) the broad types of programs that INGOs engage in, and (2) the range of possible objections governments are likely to raise (or not raise).

Though a substantial number of organizations engage in contentious programming, in general, INGOs have a fairly positive relationship with their host governments (@fig:govt-positivity-both), since maintaining some level of government tolerance is essential to staying in the country. Only 10% of respondents report having a somewhat or extremely negative relationship with their host governments, while the remainder either have a positive relationship or are ambivalent.[^28] Opinions of the positivity of this relationship depend on the type of government and the contentiousness of the INGO's issue. 60% of INGOs that reported a negative relationship work in autocracies, while only 20–30% with a positive or ambivalent relationship work in similar regimes.[^29] Similarly, 50% of organizations with a negative relationship work on contentious issues. In fact, 17% of high contention INGOs have a negative relationship with their hosts, in contrast to only 8% of low contention organizations.[^30]
 
![Opinions of relationship with host government, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-govt-positivity-both){#fig:govt-positivity-both}

Organizations working on low contention issues that align with government needs report having a close and cordial working relationship with their hosts. A health organization working in West Africa explains that "[w]e work very closely with government hospitals and universities, [and we meet with] various health ministers [regularly],"[^31]and a development organization working in Central America reports that "[w]e work very closely with the trade unions, many of whom have representatives in the National Assembly," and that they have a good relationship with the host government's foreign ministry and with their ambassador in the organization's home country.[^32] Government officials are often enthusiastic about NGO work and sometimes "verbally express their gratitude to work with" foreign NGOs.[^33] One education INGO working in a South Asian dictatorship summarizes the experiences of many low-contention organizations optimistically: "We really do not have any problem with them, mater [sic] of fact they work with us so well that when we need any kind of help they are there for us to assist. We have a great relationship."[^34]

Not all organizations enjoy such a warm relationship with the government. Some low contention organizations have poor relationships with their host governments because of poor governance, with one disaster relief INGO working in Southeast Asia reporting that "[t]here is a lot of bureaucracy and corruption. We spend so much time to get approval in the projects. We don't agree to pay bribe[s], which makes or [sic] work even more difficult."[^35] More commonly, though, highly contentious INGOs working in authoritarian countries having a more negative relationship with the regime government activities are often the raison d'être for contentious programming. A human rights INGO in Latin America notes dryly, "most typically, [governments] are the driving force of the human rights abuse we document."[^36] An organization working in Central Africa also identifies their programming as the source of this poor relationship:

> we document and report human rights violation, we organise presse conference to denounce and alert the peoples on pertinent cases, the government is against this and task us to be instrumantalised by europeans and americans, we undergo threats of all forms and some times watch our meetings monitored. [sic][^37]

This organization's mission to report on human rights violations makes its relationship with the government naturally combative, and the government responds by conflating INGO programming with former imperial influence and by closely following the organization's activities. The link between contentious programming and poor relationships is reiterated by other human rights INGOs working in Oceania and the Middle East:

> We are highly critical of them and their policies and laws. We are human rights defenders at risk of prosecution for our work in sharing information with the UN human rights mechanisms. We are monitored by the security agency.[^38]

> The government does not want us to document violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including systematic torture and abuse of civilians, civil society activists and women rights defenders.[^39]

The distance between the government and INGO preferences explains the potential contentiousness of the relationship between the two parties—the wider the distance, the more antagonistic the relationship. Evidence from the survey shows that contentious INGOs are more likely to face stricter regulations, increased scrutiny, and worse relationships with their host governments. Interestingly, however, half of contentious INGOs report strong and positive relationships with the government despite their ideological distance. Differences in preferences thus do not fully account for the de facto relationship. For a more complete explanation, we must look at interplay between two other elements of the model: an organization's instrumental flexibility and its overlap with government regulations.

## Instrumental flexibility

For Mitchell and Schmitz, organizations are primarily *driven* by their missions and *constrained* by instrumental concerns: worries about money and other resources get in the way of pursuing deeper normative principles. I argue, however, that this view of instrumentality is insufficient. Instrumental concerns, including time, money, or political connections, are not simply constraints. These resources are what allow INGOs to pursue their principled ideals in the first place—they provide organizations with the flexibility to engage in programming and adapt to the political and regulatory environments they face. The region surrounding the organization's ideal point represents its reserve of instrumental flexibility (see @fig:theory-ngo-space). This differs from Mitchell and Schmitz's concept of instrumental constraints, which can be seen in the model as the institutional forces curbing the outer limits of an organization's flexibility, such as changing regulations (e.g. laws restricting NGO activity) or norms for nonprofit organizational behavior (e.g. fears of spending too much time and effort on fundraising).

![Space around INGO ideal point: instrumental flexibility](../../Graphics/theory-ngo-space){#fig:theory-ngo-space}

Flexibility has a dual function. First, it is what allows an INGO to carry out its core mission. Instrumental flexibility can take many forms, including an organization's size, diversity of funding sources, professionalization of staff, knowledge of the host country—essentially any resource-oriented strategy that permits an organization to implement its mission effectively in dynamic environments. The link between an organization's ideals and its flexibility represents a tension unique to third sector organizations. INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Nonprofit organizations must concern themselves with resources: ignoring necessary overhead concerns in favor of pursuing its vision will limit the organization's ability to effectively fund or carry out that mission (see @Moore:2000, 195). At the same time, the pursuit of flexibility is constrained by nonprofit norms. Dedicating too much time to expanding flexibility through overhead activities like fundraising, professionalization, and marketing can erode public trust in the organization.

Second, flexibility provides INGOs with a protective margin around their core missions, and their reserve of resources determines how effectively they can respond to different forms of government restriction and regulation. When host regimes constrict the allowable space for INGO activity and put pressure on their ideal points, organizations can respond by relying on their instrumental flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their non-core programming—organizations can marshal new resources, collaborate with more partner organizations, request the support of more powerful external actors, relocate their programs to other countries, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of those constraints. The more flexibility an INGO has, the better they can adapt and the more creative and antagonistic they can potentially be; the less flexibility they have, the less so. 

Recall from @fig:govt-positivity-both that despite their potential to pose domestic political challenges, the majority of INGOs maintain a positive relationship with their host countries. This is the "amicable" side of the theory of amicable contempt—organizations can help guarantee their access to the country by acting friendly towards the regime, even if their programming might challenge the regime. But the need for amicability does not mean that organizations must give up on their core vision and mission, taming their programs to completely match their host governments' preferences, nor does it entail that governments will always be friendly to the INGOs they allow in: half of organizations with negative host-country relationships work on contentious issues, but by extension, half of the INGOs at odds with the government engage in less contentious programming. The ability of INGOs to remain in their host countries, avoid restrictions, and maintain positive relationships with the government does not depend entirely on ideal preferences. Both actors can emphasize the "contempt" of amicable contempt by making changes to the space around their ideal points. 

The survey reveals multiple sources of instrumental flexibility. Most of the organizations that responded to the survey were small, with half employing eight or fewer staff members. This does not mean, however, that the INGO sector as a whole employs few people—because of dozens of large organizations with hundreds (and even thousands) of employees, the average staff size is 50. These larger, better-staffed organizations inherently need to have access to more financial resources to pay their employees, which entails a greater need for consistent revenue flows. At the same time, having more employees provides these larger organizations with more flexibility in the face of restrictions—if an organization is limited in one country, it can more easily shift programs and staff around to work in other countries or on other topics. In addition to full time staff, the majority of INGOs (93%) rely on volunteers to help implement their missions and programs. Half of responding INGOs use 25 or fewer volunteers, and the average (290) is again inflated by large, well-funded INGOs that can afford to train, equip, and manage many more volunteers. Notably, 20% of responding organizations employ no formal staff and instead rely completely on volunteers. Having no employees does not necessarily entail an exact substitution of paid staff for unpaid volunteers. Because managing and retaining volunteers requires a substantial investment of resources, time, and training [@HagerBrudney:2004; @BrudneyMeijs:2009], organizations with no staff tend to use fewer volunteers (median = 20, mean = 242) than their staffed counterparts.

Level of reliance on sources of funding, divided by organization size
</div>

Variation in funding sources also helps determine an organization's flexibility. Government grants—from host countries, target countries, and other donor countries—are the most common stream of income reported by respondents, followed by individual donations, grants from NGOs and foundations, and corporate giving (see @fig:funding-size-totals). Additionally, dozens of respondents report generating their own income through fundraising efforts, member fees, consulting services, and unrelated business income. The size of the organization is related to the funding sources it relies on. Organizations that employ more than 50 people selected an average of 4 streams of funding, while smaller organizations reported an average of 3. The mix and selection of funding sources can also depend on organization size (see @fig:funding-size-pct). Smaller organizations are most likely to rely primarily on fundraising, member fees, and individual donations, and less heavily on grants from NGOs, foundations, and corporations. Additionally, nearly two thirds of smaller organizations explicitly eschew government funding, relying instead on other sources of revenue. Larger organizations also rely on fundraising, individual donations, and foundation grants, but are also far more likely than their smaller counterparts to draw money from governments, IGOs, and corporations. Larger INGOs tend to juggle more revenue streams to support their additional staff and programming, and these organizations are more likely to rely on government funding, which can come with more conditions and strings attached than private donations. Diversification in income sources provides flexibility—if an organization fails to obtain a government grant, it can turn to foundations, fundraising, or other sources to compensate. Organizations with more sources of funding are thus likely more flexible when facing restrictions on their programs abroad.

![Frequency of collaboration, divided by organization size](../../Output/figures/3-collaboration-size){#fig:collaboration-size}

INGOs can also find flexibility in collaborative relationships. Organizations that work in isolation can find it difficult to make adjustments or offload programs and projects when facing restrictions and limitations on their work, while those that work closely with other organizations can benefit from their expertise, support, and social networks. Most organizations indicate collaborating with at least one other actor; only nineteen respondents explicitly stated that they do not collaborate at all. INGOs tend to collaborate most frequently with other NGOs, followed by IGOs, governments, and corporations (@fig:collaboration-size). As with funding, organization size is associated with patterns of collaboration. Smaller organizations are more likely to collaborate with NGOs, while larger INGOs collaborate more frequently with governments and corporations, mirroring patterns in funding sources seen previously.

![Length of time in host country, divided by regime type](../../Output/figures/3-time-country){#fig:time-country}

A final source of operational flexibility is the familiarity an organization has with the country it targets. INGOs that have a longer presence in a country tend to have deeper institutional knowledge of that country and can better work with local officials and NGOs and navigate the bureaucracy. Responding organizations vary in how long they have been active in the countries they answered about (see @fig:time-country). Organizations working in democracies are most likely to have been in those countries for more than a decade, while those working in autocracies are equally likely to either be newer entrants (with a presence of 1–4 years) or have a more longstanding presence. 

![Main obstacles to INGO mission; multiple obstacles allowed](../../Output/figures/3-obstacles){#fig:obstacles}

Flexibility is self-reinforcing. The presence of some forms of flexibility, such as a professionalized staff, make it easier to obtain additional resources, and vice versa—the absence of flexibility imposes a host of challenges to INGO missions. Nearly 70% of respondents identified funding as the primary obstacle to pursuing their mission (see @fig:obstacles), followed by other instrumental obstacles like needing to professionalize staff, struggling to work well with local employees and staff, and coordinating efficiently with other NGOs. Without consistent funding, organizations struggle to hire staff, train volunteers, build relationships with local bureaucrats and politicians, or engage in long-term programs in their host countries. A health advocacy organization working in East Africa notes the dampening effect a lack of funding has on its flexibility, stating that the biggest obstacle to fulfilling its mission is

> [c]ore funding so we can do our work and stop spending so much time on raising money to do our work. We are activists, researchers, communications experts, we don’t want to spend our lives raising money, schmoozing funding partners and writing proposals.[^40]

These obstacles and challenges to flexibility shape and limit how well INGOs can pursue their missions, but INGOs do not generally redefine their missions in response to these challenges. Rather, when organizations make strategic adjustments to enhance access to funds, professionalize staff, or improve instrumental flexibility in general, they attempt do so without modifying their core missions. "The overall goal of the organization should remain the same," explains an anti-human trafficking INGO working in Southeast Asia, while "strategies to achieve that goal should change and grow on a regular basis, in order to adapt to the development of trends and new technologies."[^41] Similarly, a development INGO in the Caribbean identified a need to adjust instrumental strategies while maintaining their core mission: "Our goals are sound, and the way we do our work is effective, but I feel we need to revamp our fundraising strategy."[^42] Protecting the core mission is essential in the face of financial constraints, and organizations will engage in creative adjustments to maintain their values. For instance, a development INGO in Latin America relates that "[f]unding is always an issue, but in the last 5 years we have changed our strategy to work as a consultancy firm (*without losing our values, vision and mission*) so we can achieve our annual budget."[^43] Even though it changed its legal organizational form, the organization claims that the shift enabled it to more effectively "improve the business ecosystem" and "create value to society" throughout Latin America.

![In-country operational strategies; multiple answers allowed](../../Output/figures/3-operations){#fig:operations}

The amount of flexibility an organization enjoys influences the variety of programs and strategies it is able to implement. For instance, @fig:operations shows the frequency responding organizations engage in four broad types of operations: funding local NGOs, partnering directly with local NGOs, maintaining an office staffed by locals, and maintaining an office staffed by foreigners. Most respondents partner with domestic NGOs and maintain locally-staffed countries when possible. Organizations with more flexibility, however, selected more strategies. On average, employing more staff, drawing from more funding sources, and collaborating with more partners are each associated with a greater number of operational strategies. Organizations with 50 or more employees selected an average of 1.5 broad strategies, while organizations with fewer than 50 employees selected an average of 1.3.[^44] @fig:instrumental-stuff-strategies in the appendix visually demonstrates how the number of funding sources and collaborative partners is associated with the number of strategies selected—INGOs with few partners or revenue streams are the least likely to have a diversified set of strategies. Better funded, staffed, and cooperative INGOs can afford to manage offices in multiple countries and fund and partner with local organizations, and can thus confront external challenges to their missions more effectively.

A human rights INGO working in Latin America summarizes the importance of flexibility succinctly, explaining that the largest obstacle to carrying out their mission is "the small size of the organization and the lack of economic resources to ensure the maintenance of activities independently of the public authorities."[^45] Without robust instrumental flexibility, INGOs risk losing both access to their host countries and independence from interference by their host countries.

Thus, international NGOs are generally driven by their core missions and principles, but must pursue their programming within instrumental constraints. The results from the survey strengthen previous work by @MitchellSchmitz:2014 and others, demonstrating how INGOs find themselves caught in a dilemma between principles and instrumentality. I add to this work by arguing that instrumental concerns are not always constraints—the pursuit of resources enables INGO missions in the first place and provides organizations with instrumental flexibility. Additionally, flexibility allows organizations to protect their core missions and avoid changing them in the face of obstacles. The difficulty for nonprofit organizations is to strike the proper balance—focusing too much on mission and ignoring the need for resources can lead to untenable and unfunded programming, while focusing too much on obtaining resources and enhancing flexibility can become an inferior substitute for an organization's more principled goals.

## Practical operating environment 

Even under favorable political circumstances, all nonprofit organizations—international NGOs included—walk a difficult tightrope between the dual pressures of mission and money. This balancing act becomes even more difficult when the institutional and political environments INGOs work to constrict, target, and limit their programming. Beyond financial and staffing constraints, a third of respondents indicated that domestic politics, laws, bureaucracies, corruption, and conflict also pose substantial burdens to their programming (see @fig:obstacles). Respondents note that they are limited by "shrinking civil space"[^46] and "increasingly restrictive laws in countries where our members operate"[^47] in the countries they target, by "[c]onstant attempts by public and private actors to restrict freedom of expression and media freedom"[^48] and by direct government interference in their activities.[^49]

As shown in previous chapters, autocratic governments are highly concerned with regime stability and longevity, and changes in a country's Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) and in its formal set of laws and regulations are closely tied to shifts in internal politics, external threats, and reputational pressures. INGOs must keep up with changes in the regulatory environment of their host countries and be aware of statutory and bureaucratic reforms in order to ensure that their activities fall within the bounds set by the regime. The overlap of an organization's flexibility and a government's CSRE determines the practical operating environment for the INGO. NGO regulations are not inherently limiting—many regulations exist to help regularize INGO-state relations and represent a large overlapping space. As the size of the overlap decreases, however, the practical operating environment for INGOs becomes constrained and organizations risk expulsion.

![Overlap of space around ideal points: practical operating environment](../../Graphics/theory-space-overlap){#fig:theory-space-overlap}

Because governments set the initial conditions for operating, being aware of the regulatory environment is crucial for INGOs to make appropriate adjustments and maintain legal status their host countries. INGOs tend to be quite aware of the regulatory environment of their host countries, with more than 80% of respondents somewhat or very familiar with the laws regulating their activities (see @fig:familiarity-both).[^50] Familiarity is affected by the type of regime organizations work in. More than 75% of respondents who answered that they do not know anything about regulations work in democracies, while those most familiar with the regulatory environment are split roughly equally between democracies and autocracies.[^51] INGOs working in dictatorships are the most likely to be the most familiar with regulations, likely because deep knowledge of the legal environment is more essential to operate safely and effectively. The contentiousness of the issues INGOs work on does not help determine their familiarity—high contention INGOs are not more or less likely to be more aware of the legal environment.[^52]

![Knowledge of regulatory environment in host government, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-familiarity-both){#fig:familiarity-both}

INGOs report that the regulatory environment can change frequently—half of respondents report that regulations and laws change every few years, and nearly 20% say regulations change at least once a year (see @fig:frequency).[^53] The regime type of the host country is closely related to how frequently INGOs see changes in regulations. Nearly two thirds of the INGOs that report changes at least once a year work in autocracies, which contrasts starkly with the two thirds of INGOs that experience a static legal environment in democratic host countries.[^54] 

![Frequency of changes in regulatory environment for NGOs in host country, separated by regime type (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type)](../../Output/figures/3-frequency){#fig:frequency}

Given their frequency, the regulatory changes INGOs observe do not necessarily correlate with formal statutory developments. For instance, as described previously, Egypt has only formally passed civil society laws in 2002 and 2012. These laws give bureaucrats and politicians significant interpretive leeway, however, and allow them to reshape the regulatory environment for international NGOs. Because of this dynamic discretionary de facto environment, INGOs actively seek out information about changes in laws, rules, and regulations (see @fig:change-how-find-out). International NGOs are most likely to hear about new legal changes from other NGOs in the country, both from their local partners and from other foreign organizations. They also receive news about changes directly from government officials, sometimes at inopportune moments. One INGO working in East Africa, unaware of any changes in regulations, discovered new funding requirements for foreign NGOs when requesting permits to expand their operations in the country—the organization ultimately decided to not expand as a result.[^55] INGOs also find out about changes in laws through the media and through internet research, including websites that aggregate information about civil society regulations like Civicus and the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL). The fact that INGOs tend to seek out the latest information about their regulatory environment shows that these organizations are active participants in their relationship with their host governments, regularly measuring and testing the acceptable boundaries for their work. 

![Channels of discovering changes in the regulatory environment for NGOs in host country](../../Output/figures/3-change-how-find-out){#fig:change-how-find-out}

Not all changes in NGO laws lead to restrictions on activities, however. In work with Suparna Chaudhry, I find that the global increase in NGO laws is partly attributable to the routinization of NGO–government relations [@ChaudhryHeiss:2017; see also @BloodgoodTremblay-Boire:2016]. For example, governments may require NGO registration in an attempt to formally define their relationship with civil society, and those registration laws will not necessarily be burdensome. Data from @ChristensenWeinstein:2013 helps demonstrate this difference in restrictiveness. @fig:djcw-reg-regime shows the prevalence of NGO registration laws in 98 countries from 1990–2013. Roughly the same proportion of autocracies and democracies require that NGOs register, and both types of countries have increased this type of legislation at similar rates over time. However, far more autocracies make these registration laws burdensome, at a much faster rate. This suggests that there is an imperative to regularize state-NGO relations around the world, implying that the changes in laws that INGO respondents observe are not necessarily harmful. At the same time, there is a move to increase the burden of these more benign laws in autocracies, making it more difficult for NGOs to operate in these contexts.

![Proportion of countries with laws that require NGO registration and that impose additional burdens on the registration process, by regime type [@ChristensenWeinstein:2013]](../../Output/figures/3-dcjw-reg-regime){#fig:djcw-reg-regime}

Survey respondents confirm this. Nearly two-thirds of INGOs feel the most restricted and constrained by government regulations work in autocracies, compared to 25% of organizations that report facing no restrictions in similar regimes (see @fig:restriction-both).[^56] The relationship between host country regime type and feelings of restriction is quite marked, with the proportion of respondents working in autocracies decreasing steadily as the feeling of restriction decreases. Interestingly, there is not as clear of a relationship between the contentiousness of INGO programming and feelings of restriction. Half of highly restricted organizations work on contentious issues, but there is no significant difference between the other levels of restriction—roughly 25% of organizations that did not consider themselves highly restricted engage in contentious programming. It thus appears that the findings in @fig:djcw-reg-regime hold true—governments are increasingly passing routine NGO laws, but those laws are far more burdensome in autocracies where they are designed to restrict NGO activities.

![Feeling of restriction in host country, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-restriction-both){#fig:restriction-both}


The overlap of INGO instrumental flexibility and a government's de facto regulatory environment thus determines the practical operating environment for INGO activities, which in turn imposes additional constraints on these organizations. All nonprofit organizations face an internal conflict between mission and money, but nonprofits working as guests in repressive host countries are subject to regulatory vagaries linked to domestic political struggles. INGOs spend resources to remain aware of changes in the regulatory environment and generally work to ensure that their programs do not lead to expulsion. For most INGOs, maintaining access to the country is critical for successfully undertaking their missions, and as a result, most organizations—including half of the more contentious respondents—try to uphold somewhat of a good relationship with their host governments. 


# Aims of government regulation

Thus far, we understand *why* governments regulate INGOs—previous chapters showed that autocratic regimes see international NGOs as an institutional actor that plays a role in their stability-seeking calculus, and governments pass new laws and selectively adjust existing regulations in response to internal, external, and reputational threats to stability. Understanding the mechanisms of the amicable contempt framework from the perspective of the INGO—including the conflict between mission, money, and the resulting practical operating environment—now allows us to explore *how* governments regulate INGOs, and more importantly, *how* INGOs respond to these attempts. 

Government regulation of international NGOs can be categorized into two general types—gatekeeping and program capture—each corresponding to an element of an INGO's theoretical preferences and flexibility (see @fig:theory-regulation-purpose). Gatekeeping regulations are designed to limit the amount of instrumental flexibility an NGO can exercise, thus reducing the size of the practical operating environment and creating a less tolerant relationship. These regulations are not primarily intended to change how an organization runs. Instead, these laws impose barriers to entry—mainly through complex registration requirements—that give the government the ability to keep potentially destabilizing organizations out or to later revoke the permission of organizations that become politically dangerous after initially registering. Gatekeeping laws also limit the potential risks of INGO programming by establishing barriers to assembly, advocacy, and speech, prohibiting NGOs from engaging in undesired activities. 

![Goals of government regulation of INGOs: gatekeeping and program capture](../../Graphics/theory-regulation-purpose){#fig:theory-regulation-purpose}

Gatekeeping restrictions can also occur in more indirect ways, as regimes create their own parallel NGOs to crowd out independent organizations. Government operated NGOs (GONGOs) are typically lead by first ladies [@Heydemann:2007] or close regime allies [@Stacher:2012, 79] who use the organizations as platforms to explicitly support the government, often bestowing the regime a humanitarian veneer. These organizations tend to deal with apolitical issues that attract global attention and praise, such as "service provision, education, training, sports, [and] youth development," [@Heydemann:2007, 8] as well as issues affecting women and children. For example, as the former head of the National Council of Women and the Suzanne Mubarak Women's International Peace Movement, the former Egyptian first lady gained wide international praise for her humanitarian and social efforts [@Yerkes:2012, 22]. Similarly, Jordan's Queen Rania has launched dozens of initiatives and GONGOs focused on childhood education, women's issues, and refugee support, also to much praise [@Carapico:2002, 392]. While these GONGOs can engage in important humanitarian work, they also permit the regime to siphon government and private funding away from the independent civil society sector—essentially allowing the ruler to intercept donations and weaken the instrumental flexibility of existing domestic and international NGOs. For instance, the 2013 Jordanian budget allocated 1 million dinar ($1.4 million) for government funding of civil society organizations, but 450,000 dinar were reserved for organizations headed by the queen and royal family, cutting the pool available for other NGOs in half [@Abdel-Samad:2017]. Creating and funding GONGOs does not help regimes take control over international NGOs, but is a useful strategy for starving them of resources and limiting their scope. Gatekeeping regulations exist to limit NGO activity and offset its risks by targeting organizational flexibility, forcing organizations to spend significant time and money to remain in the country. These kinds of laws are not designed to change how organizations are managed or run. 

Regulations focused on program capture, on the other hand, *are* created (often explicitly) to encourage realignment of organizational missions and pull INGO ideal points closer to government preferences, thus creating a more cooperative relationship (see again @fig:theory-regulation-purpose). Reaping the benefits of INGO services requires some alignment of government and INGO preferences, and regimes can use two different regulatory strategies—control and co-optation—to induce changes in and assert power over INGO programming. First, a regime can take outright control over the civil society sector or impose strict limitations on its activity that force it to align with the government. As discussed previously, in December 2012, President Mohamed Morsi announced new legislation that would nationalize all civil society organizations working in Egypt and treat them as part of the Social Affairs Ministry. NGO staff would be considered civil servants and would fall under complete control and oversight of the government [@ngo-law:2012]. Though this proposal was eventually tabled, new legislation was passed in early 2013 that prohibited NGOs from participating in political activities, required the retroactive registration of 40,000 organizations, and created additional bureaucratic hurdles to receive approval for most projects [@Halawa:2013; @cihrs:2013]. Strong backlash from domestic and international human and civil rights groups prevented the law from being fully implemented in both 2013 and 2014 [@ap-egypt-ngos:2014], but elements of the draft made it into the final version approved by parliament in 2016 and signed into law in 2017. Organizations are prohibited from engaging in any activities that the government deems harmful to "national security, law and order, public morals, or public health," and organizations cannot conduct surveys or publish reports without first obtaining government approval of the results [@Egyptian-parliament:2016], thus providing the regime with editorial control over the content of NGO activities. 

Government attempts to unabashedly nationalize civil society are rare and generally limited to domestic organizations, as taking direct control over international NGOs poses difficult jurisdictional legal issues. Instead, governments can impose their preferences and oversight on NGOs through less direct means. The foreign NGO law that took effect in China in January 2017 now requires that all non-Chinese NGOs work with a professional supervisory unit (PSU), or a dedicated government agency approved by the Ministry of Public Security. PSUs and other government offices have the responsibility to report on the activities of their partner NGOs and have the ability to approve or deny "visits, international cooperation, foreign donations, and other contact with foreign organizations or donors" [@icnl-china]. Thus, while not fully nationalized, INGOs in China are severely limited by bureaucratic whims and regime preferences. 

Regimes can also exert control over NGO programming by positioning themselves directly in organizations' governance structures. In 2006, for instance, a banker and an academic in the Dubai founded a secular-leaning human rights NGO named the Emirates Human Rights Association (EHRA). They initially had the government's tacit permission, but the ruling regime soon modified the legal requirements for the organization to continue. Fearing the outcome of the organization's advocacy and shaming (the NGO's founders noted that "the government is afraid of us"), the government attempted to pack the organization's board with its own representatives, demanding that the NGO "accept five current and former members of the security apparatus into our board, and the sheikhs in Abu Dhabi hinted that they wanted us to choose Mohammed Fahd Al-Dehim, another person affiliated with the security agencies, as our chairman" [@06DUBAI1729]. The founders discovered a legal technicality to deny Al-Dehim the chairmanship and the other five security officials subsequently withdrew from the board, but the NGO worried about future government incursions, turned to the US State Department for advice, and continues to have a contentious relationship with the government today. While EHRA is a domestic NGO, in chapter 6 I will explore how governments use similar strategies of board packing with international NGOs.

Controlling INGOs, either through nationalization or through enhanced administrative involvement, is costly and requires substantial government effort and coordination. A more common and subtle strategy for controlling both domestic and international civil society is co-optation. Instead of attempting to directly control NGOs, the regime offers benefits to potential challengers in exchange for loyalty [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014; @Moore:2000a; @Corntassel:2007]. For civil society organizations, these benefits are primarily financial, and regimes can manage NGO funding channels to ensure that formal civil society organizations are vertically linked to the state's central authority. This phenomenon has been seen in domestic contexts. For example, in post-Oslo Palestine, hundreds of new associations and nonprofits appeared in the wake of the new peace process, but access to resources was limited by these organizations' connections to Yasser Arafat's ruling Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Palestinian associations that supported the PNA received more funding from the government and national donors. As such, many Palestinian association leaders built vertical networks linking their organizations to the state, rather than with members of the communities they served. In one instance, a sports club in Ramallah transformed into a community office linked directly to the PNA, allowing its members to access medical assistance and other unrelated benefits from the government. The PNA successfully insinuated itself into society and transformed civil society into a vertical patronage network [@Jamal:2007, 52–56].

Funding laws in Russia serve a similar purpose. In 2004, President Putin established the Public Chamber system, which established regional offices responsible for mediating state-civil society relations and for distributing funds to organizations. Russia's subsequent anti-NGO statutes in 2006, 2012, and 2015 have strengthened the role of the Public Chamber, shaping it into one of the only legitimate means for domestic NGOs to obtain financial support [@Flikke:2015]. In an effort to collect funds from this government office, NGOs must either "re-orientate themselves to the aims of the state or look for other sources of funding," and as a result of forced government funding of civil society, NGOs are increasingly acting as "the agents of social policy, not the influencers of it" [@CrottyHallLjubownikow:2014, 1264]. Eliminating avenues of funding and acting as the sole distributer of NGO resources, therefore, allows governments to co-opt these organizations. 
 
Controlling funding is not the only strategy for linking civil society to the regime—aspirations for political power or promises of financial stability can also be dangled as an incentive to work closely with the government. @Liverani:2008 argues that Algerian associational life was too closely linked to the ruling regime to have any impact on genuine democratization, while @Wiktorowicz:2000 and @Blaydes:2011 similarly show how Islamist political parties in Jordan and Egypt follow an almost identical pattern, changing their ideological agendas to gain political power within the authoritarian regime. Ultimately, co-optation is a "reorganization of existing structures of state authority" [@Marzouk:1997, 195] where civil society organizations become the "mediators between the people's demands and the administration's offers" [@Nefissa:2005, 8]—the state successfully institutionalizes NGOs as tools of regime stability.

# Reactions to types of government regulations

Authoritarian governments thus design their civil society regulatory environment to target different elements of an INGO's organizational preferences—gatekeeping regulations keep potentially harmful organizations out of the country and seek to limit the practical operating environment by reducing organizational flexibility, while program capture regulations allow regimes to take advantage of their guest organizations and seek to distort organizational values. Given the different purposes of these types of regulations, international NGOs are motivated by different concerns when contemplating how to react to government restrictions. Likewise, institutional and organizational characteristics—namely the contentiousness of the INGO–government relationship and the amount of instrumental flexibility enjoyed by the INGO—help determine these organizations' reactions. @tbl:ingo-reactions-summary provides a helpful overview of these different pressures, concerns, and reactions.

\elandscape

When confronting gatekeeping regulations, an INGO's primary concern is to gain or maintain access to the country. An INGO's level of contentiousness, in concert with the government's civil society regulatory environment, determines how much regulatory pressure the INGO will face. Highly contentious organizations will face higher scrutiny as regimes attempt to limit their access to the country, head off potential political threats, and make the practical operating environment more difficult. In response, organizations that enjoy greater instrumental flexibility can either make creative adjustments on the margins of their missions (i.e. without redefining their core) to adapt to these laws, or exit the country and work in exile. Organizations with less flexibility, on the other hand, are less likely to be able to adjust to the operating environment and will cease their work, exit the country, avoid entering the country in the first place, or maintain a low profile and avoid contact with the government as much as possible. Correspondingly, because they pose less of a political threat to the regime, low contention organizations will face less pressure and scrutiny and should not need to make as many creative adjustments to remain in the country.

In contrast, when facing regulations designed to capture their programs, INGOs are concerned with protecting their core mission and ensuring that complying with government regulations, cooperating with the host government, and allowing for a degree of control or co-optation does not conflict with their values. While gatekeeping regulations are designed to target all potential organizations and act as a filter, program capture regulations target only those organizations allowed in the country. As such, the government exerts a different type of pressure. Because their programs are more closely aligned with government preferences, gatekeeping regulations are typically less onerous for low contention organizations. Once in the country, though, the pressure to remain aligned with the government and capitulate to regime demands of control and co-optation increases, as governments try to ensure that INGOs continue to play along. Organizations with high instrumental flexibility will be able to resist or adjust to government attempts at co-optation, while those with fewer resources and less flexibility will be more likely to either concede to government demands or exit the country. High contention organizations face a different dynamic. INGOs that are able to overcome gatekeeping regulations and *enter* the country are more likely to have high flexibility, and are thus more likely to be able to resist co-optation, while INGOs that remain *outside* of the country and work from exile because of strict gatekeeping laws also are more likely to have high flexibility and can more easily resist co-optation.

In the following two chapters, I integrate large-*n* and small-*n* analysis to explore INGO reactions to gatekeeping and program capture regulations. Previously, I used nested analysis to determine when and why authoritarian regimes regulate INGOs: the results of the large-*n* statistical models informed the selection and analysis of international NGO regulations in Egypt, Russia, and China. I employ a similar approach here, combining the results from the global survey of INGOs (large-*n* analysis) with more detailed process tracing and analysis of specific cases on INGOs that have worked in repressive regimes (small-*n* analysis). This method differs from the nested approach outlined by @Lieberman:2005, though, in one crucial aspect—I do not use the results of the large-*n* analysis of to guide the selection of the small-*n* cases. I diverge from standard nested analysis for two reasons. The first is practical: I promised survey respondents anonymity to encourage candor and I did not want to inadvertently expose private information by conducting more detailed case studies about selected survey respondents. The second is methodological: standard nested analysis requires that small-*n* cases be selected from a statistical model based on how well observations fit (or do not fit) the model's predictions. The open-ended and non-representative nature of the INGO survey does not lend itself to regression analysis, thus making it impossible to select cases based on model performance. I thus follow the spirit of integrative mixed methods, if not the exact letter. I identify reactions and trends in the INGO survey and compare them to the experiences of four paradigmatic INGOs: Article 19, AMERA UK / Egypt / International,  Index on Censorship, and the International Republican Institute (IRI).

[^15]:	The probability that the difference in proportion of high and low contention INGOs selecting "Almost always" is greater than zero is generally substantial: high contention organizations = advocacy ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.01$), monitoring ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.03$), and mobilizing ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.13$); low contention organizations = aid and services ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.87$); there is no substantial difference between the responses of high and low contention organizations for engaging in research and public education ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.47$). All posterior probabilities are available in @tbl:main-activities-p in the appendix.

[^50]:	It is important to remember that this high percentage is likely tied to who responded to the survey—as explained previously, more than 50% of respondents were the organization's CEO, executive director, or other high-level officer.

	"Extremely familiar" and "Very familiar" are collapsed to "Very familiar"; "Moderately familiar" and "Slightly familiar" are collapsed to "Somewhat familiar."

[^51]:	$P(\% \text{ Very familiar}_\text{Autocracies} - \% \text{ Not familiar at all}_\text{Autocracies} > 0) = 0.99$.

[^52]:	$P(\% \text{ Very familiar}_\text{High contention} - \% \text{ Not familiar at all}_\text{High contention} > 0) = 0.45$.

[^53]:	"Once a month" and "Once a year" are collapsed to "At least once a year."

[^54]:	$P(\% \text{ At least once a year}_\text{Autocracies} - \% \text{ Rarely or never}_\text{Autocracies} > 0) = 0.97$.
