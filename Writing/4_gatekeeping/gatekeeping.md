Gatekeeping laws are aimed at making life difficult for NGOs, not at inducing changes or capturing their mission. 

Because of this, when facing gatekeeping restrictions, INGOs respond primarily by making marginal changes to their programming, drawing on their flexibility, etc. to remain in the country.

In this case, however, I do not use the results of the LNA to guide the selection of SNA. I do this for two reasons.

# Limiting INGO flexibility through gatekeeping

Regulations that *are* designed to be burdensome target both elements of an INGO's organizational preferences (see @tbl:ingo-reactions-summary). INGOs confront each of these types of regulation by drawing on their flexibility to either (1) maintain access to the country, or (2) protect against changes to their missions. 



TODO: A couple paragraphs outlining:

- Theoretical form of regulation (see gatekeeping part of @fig:theory-regulation-purpose): Host governments constrict the civil society regulatory environment in order to limit organizational flexibility and control which INGOs are allowed in the country
- Effects on INGOs: Laws slow things down, make life difficult, filter out the most contentious; limit funding, decrease efficacy of programs
- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious, organizations will maintain good relationship with the government, follow registration laws, keep within government limits. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will find ways around registration, avoid fees, outsource regulations, work regardless of registration status, work in exile, create smaller programs, fund irregularly, channel funds through domestic partners, etc.
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes


TODO: Finish this ¶: governments want to limit foreign influence, mitigate political risks

In chapter two, I argued that authoritarian regimes see international NGOs as an institutional threat to regime stability. Respondent experiences reinforce this finding, reflecting how many authoritarian host governments clearly see foreign NGOs as dangers. Respondents note that their relationship with the government is often affected by the political atmosphere[^1] and that international NGOs in particular are seen as risky political actors.[^2] Some NGOs feel that accusations of acting as foreign political operatives are baseless and note that there is "much hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^3]

The foreign provenance of international NGOs appears to be the overriding trigger of fears for stability, most likely because it is more difficult to directly regulate or control non-domestic organizations. A conflict resolution INGO working in East Africa argues that it is difficult to work with the host government because "any organization or investor from […] another country is viewed as a threat to the government of [the country], especially on issues resolving conflicts and human right[s]."[^4] Governments are especially wary of foreign organizations that work directly with citizens—for instance, one human rights INGO in East Africa feels like the government considers it a threat to national security when staff conduct trainings in the community.[^5] Fears of foreign influence are not limited solely to contentious organizations. An education INGO working in Southern Africa reports government suspicion of their pro-education advocacy and training, noting that "[t]he government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence."[^6]

## Entry gatekeeping: regulating registration

Registration is the form of regulation most clearly linked to goals of gatekeeping, and is one of the most common forms of government regulation of NGO activities—as seen previously in @fig:djcw-reg-regime, more than half of countries require that NGOs register with a government agency. NGO experiences with registration, however, are mixed. More than two-thirds of responding organizations report feeling moderately or substantially affected by registration laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), and organizations working on contentious issues are more likely to face substantial restrictions. However, feelings of restriction and actual registration are not necessarily linked—roughly half of respondents are *not* formally registered in their host countries (see top panel of @fig:registration-all), and there is no significant difference between the registration status of INGOs working either in autocratic regimes or working on contentious issues. Registration status is correlated, however, with organizations' overall perceptions of restriction (see bottom panel of @fig:registration-all). In both types of regimes, organizations that report not feeling restricted are the most likely to not be registered, while those that feel moderately restricted are the least likely to register. In the absence of strict registration laws, many INGOs can fly under the radar and avoid formal registration. For example, a development INGO in Latin America reports "We're not registered… we just 'do our own thing'; so far the government has paid no attention to us in any way."[^7] As governments increase their enforcement of registration laws, INGOs feel more restricted and are more likely to be registered. However, the relationship between registration status and perceptions of restriction diverges for the most restricted INGOs. Organizations that report feeling the most restricted are just as likely to be registered as their unrestricted (and largely unregistered) counterparts, generally because it is exceptionally difficult and costly to formally register.

The experiences of responding NGOs reveals much about the effects of registration requirements on programming decisions. Organizations working in democratic contexts generally face little trouble in registering, noting that the process tends require "just some formalities… [and] administrative work" such as submission of annual reports, board minutes, and basic financial statements to government authorities, which does not ultimately have any negative impact on their daily work.[^8] Those working in more difficult political environments shared differing experiences. Common complaints about registration dealt with its duration, cost, and arbitrary process. Organizations explain that "it takes a large number of steps to become registered [and] rules are not clearly articulated."[^9] INGOs working in highly autocratic countries like Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Nigeria report registration processes that take 3–7 years to complete, days of travel to government offices in capital cities, and thousands of dollars in fees and side payments.[^10]  Others also face arbitrary registration requirements invented by local officials, saying that "conditions have been added randomly on our NGO without any basis."[^11] In some countries, international organizations face a double registration requirement—an education INGO working in Latin America spent several years obtaining registration status only to discover that even with formal registration, they had to incorporate a domestic NGO to gain legal personhood and access to the banking system and courts, a process which took another four years.[^12] The bureaucratic bottlenecks do not stop after this initial registration—a religious humanitarian services INGO working in the Caribbean spends at least three months every year working to secure annual renewal of that status, which imposes substantial administrative costs and causes delays in importing food and medical supplies.[^13]

When facing gatekeeping restrictions like registration laws, INGOs use their instrumental flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their programming to maintain overlap with regime preferences. Often, no adjustment is needed—most low contention organizations already overlap with regime preferences and willingly comply with registration regulations without issues. One development INGO working in East Africa represents the experiences of many other organizations, reporting that "because [our organization] is supported and invited by the […] governments themselves, we do not have problems with the ability to pursue missions. Being invited means that we are welcome to operate and pursue each mission," and because of their clear overlap with government preferences, they are "in complete compliance … with these rules and regulations without falter."[^14]   

When the distance between regime and ideal points is more distant and the relationship more antagonistic, INGOs use their flexibility and resources to act more creatively. Some organizations, for instance, seek out the friendliest and most amenable bureaucrats when registering or communicating with the government. A development INGO working in Oceania that was struggling to obtain permission to work in the country and import aid supplies stopped approaching ministry-level officials after repeated failure. Instead, they turned to local bureaucrats, who in turn obtained permission from their respective ministry heads.[^15] This workaround depends on the organization's instrumental flexibility, though, and is only possible with some knowledge of intragovernmental relationships—the INGO had to cultivate and understand those relationships over time in order to take advantage of them to expedite registration. 

More often, rather than creatively navigate the bureaucracy, organizations actively limit their contact with the government. It is important to note that this active avoidance of the government is different from the experiences of INGOs that are allowed to "do [their] own thing." In those cases, the preferences for both the government and INGO overlap and governments see no need to require registration or regular contact. In contrast, INGOs react with active avoidance when the government pulls back the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to control INGO activity. INGOs must wield and extend their flexibility to cope with this shift. Organizations will "avoid any contact with government officials"[^16] and work carefully to "reduce our visibility"[^17] in circumstances where registration and other gatekeeping rules are too restrictive, and exceptionally strict regulations can drive INGOs underground and severely inhibit their ability to carry out their mission. 

Sometimes INGOs change their headquarters within their host countries in response to increased government scrutiny. One organization working in Southeast Asia moved its headquarters to a more remote part of the country after local authorities became aware that they were not fully compliant with all regulations, while others working in Eastern Europe and Central Asia relocated to avoid uncooperative and "not ethical" officials who decided that the INGOs were not compliant.[^18] Finally, some organizations—particularly those with more contentious mission—move out of the country completely and work in exile because of the arbitrary (and targeted) enforcement of registration requirements.[^19]  

INGOs require sufficient resources and flexibility to engage in these strategies of active avoidance. Moving headquarters is expensive and time-consuming, and the organizations that report doing so tend to have more streams of revenue, employees, staff, or collaborative relationships than the average respondent. An organization working in the Middle East illustrates the importance of having increased flexibility to deal with registration restrictions.[^20] The INGO provides humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war and their host government is hostile towards them. The organization reports that "they do not want us to operate there" and that registration is difficult. As a result, the INGO actively avoids any contact with government officials and flies under the radar as much as possible. Though hiding from the government puts the organization at risk for expulsion and forecloses officially sanctioned streams of revenue from government ministries, the organization is able to sustain itself legally and financially through connections to other larger IGOs and INGOs like the World Food Programme, the Red Crescent, and large American churches, which provide the INGO with substantial funding and legal support.

In contrast, a humanitarian aid INGO working in the Caribbean provides an example of how low instrumental flexibility limits organizational effectiveness under strict registration regulations.[^21] The respondent explains that the organization is out of compliance with most gatekeeping laws, but that "in principle, I don't like being out of compliance." The organization is not officially registered with the government, which leads to difficult legal consequences. The respondent says:

> It is a very complex and lengthy process to register a foreign organization. It cost over $10,000 and many, many trips into the capital to complete. It meant that for our first 7 years of operation, we were not an official organization and could not purchase property or vehicles in the org's name.

In the absence of legal standing and access to the courts or property registration system, the organization keeps its programming hidden as much as possible and even avoids putting logos on their vehicles or advertising their work to the public. While the organization is able to fulfill its mission of improving health in rural communities, it feels held back by its precarious legal situation and is unable to scale up, fearing the legal ramifications that could follow "if we grow big enough where we can no longer fly under the radar." The respondent identifies low funding as the primary barrier to both emerging from the regulatory shadows and to scaling up its operations. With more opportunities for fundraising and grant writing, the organization would be able to register and find firmer legal standing, but the absence of these resources "is holding back growth." The organization has not shifted its core mission to become more friendly to the regime, but its lack of flexibility has relegated it to the margins.

Thus, because these laws are aimed at controlling access to the country, INGOs facing registration restrictions strive to maintain their access. INGOs that have a more cooperative relationship with their host governments generally do not face difficulties complying with these regulations. When the relationship is more antagonistic, INGOs react to stricter registration regulations by drawing on their instrumental flexibility to creatively confront the rules or avoid the government entirely, all in the hope of avoiding shifting their core missions.

## Program gatekeeping: regulating assembly and speech

Registration laws are not the only mechanism for controlling INGOs. Once organizations are allowed in, governments can use laws that restrict freedom of assembly and speech to exercise gatekeeping power over the types of programs that are permitted. This allows governments to limit potential risks of foreign influence that could stem from INGO programming. Laws restricting assembly and speech are typically designed to prevent mass political and social protests, but these laws also affect many NGO programs. One INGO working in Southern Africa explains that "the government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence. … The government associates international NGOs with politics which is not entirely true."[^22] Organizations engaged in more contentious advocacy are especially prone to enhanced government scrutiny and fears of political influence. The majority of respondents who reported substantial or moderate difficulties with limits on assembly and speech work on contentious issues (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), but noncontentious organizations also get caught up in these additional restrictions. An organization in South Asia providing disaster relief downplayed government fears of the potential political influence of NGOs, condemning its host government's "hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^23]

The potentially political nature of INGO programming leads to stricter limitations on assembly. In a few highly repressive cases, there is a ban on all meetings, rallies, and protests,[^24] but such prohibitions are rare. Instead, respondents report that bureaucrats set the terms for the gatherings and grant or deny permission to meet. In most authoritarian countries, NGOs need police or government clearance to hold any public gathering or assembly.[^25] Activities must be pre-planned and be demonstrably well organized, and even if all rules and regulations are followed, applications and permits can be denied or revoked arbitrarily and without explanation.[^26]INGOs also face restrictions on speech—a media development organization working in Eastern Africa has to receive ministry approval for all their scripts and training materials[^27]Even with permission to engage in speech or advocacy, there are still substantial risks: one human rights advocacy INGO working in Southeast Asia reported that ten of its members were arrested and imprisoned because they had participated in a peaceful political protest.[^28] 

How do INGOs react to and accommodate these restrictions? Again, because INGOs facing gatekeeping restrictions are most concerned with maintaining access to the country, organizations confront restrictions on assembly and speech by drawing on their instrumental resources and flexibility. However, unlike registration laws, which many organizations are able to skirt by flying under the radar and avoiding contact with the government, hiding more public activities like workshops, meetings, and rallies imposes heavier costs on organizations and carries a higher risk of punishment for noncompliance. As such, the majority of respondents lack the ability or will to marshal resources to challenge these laws and instead tend to comply with speech and assembly regulations and will make their political neutrality quite public.

Organizations whose core missions do not involve large gatherings and protests actively eschew the appearance of politics: a human trafficking organization working in Southeast Asia noted that they "do not have problems with freedom to assembly since we are not engage in leftist activities,"[^29] while a children's INGO in Eastern Europe sidesteps restrictions through the "simple use of discretion (avoid politically motivated gatherings) [sic]."[^30] Respondents also engage in frequent self-censorship to signal their benign intentions to their host regimes. Organizations are aware of "unwritten limitations to how much [their] advocacy work can go" and fear being seen as anti-regime, since crossing unstated government red lines encourages "government operatives [to] start looking for trivial faults as [a] way [of] shutting us up."[^31] Most INGOs "take care not to cross" these lines and pay careful attention to the phrasing of their public statements, avoiding any overt criticism of their host countries.[^32]

Similarly, organizations that are inherently more contentious, that cannot avoid the appearance of politics, or that offer public activities involving many participants maintain access to the country primarily by following regulations regarding speech and assembly. Even many of the most contentious human rights INGOs attempt to obtain permits and official permission for their public-facing programming. For instance, in response to the arrests of its members and because of its inability to formally register in the country, the human rights INGO working in Southeast Asia changed how it trains its partners within that country and now communicates with activists online through Facebook Messenger and Skype.[^33] Other organizations make marginal adjustments to their programming to adhere to assembly laws without actually changing the core purpose of that programming. One organization implements its mission of teaching peace building and interfaith cooperation in countries facing religious and ethnic conflict by holding large-scale public events and workshops with thousands of attendees. Because speech and assembly laws in one of the Southeast Asian countries the INGO targets prohibit such events, though, the organization breaks these workshops into smaller, more frequent events, working with "hundreds, not thousands" at a time.[^34] 

INGOs are able to make these adjustments only when they have sufficient flexibility to do so. The human rights INGO in Southeast Asia works closely with European politicians and UN diplomats and has access to lawyers that can bring human rights abuse cases to local, European, and international courts. It also has to technology and can help domestic activists access the internet safely, allowing for secure remote trainings and workshops. Similarly, the peace building INGO in Southeast Asia has sufficient money, time, and staff to host many small events in part because of its many collaborative relationships with several IGOs and large Western foundations. Without these resources, these organizations would likely not confront or adapt to the restrictions on assembly and speech and would struggle to maintain their access to their respective target countries. 

Thus, as with registration restrictions, INGOs facing assembly and speech restrictions are concerned primarily with maintaining access to the country. Confronting these laws, however, is more costly and risky and not always necessary. When their core mission does not entail a political threat to the government, INGOs react by engaging in self-censorship or publicly demonstrating their political neutrality. When INGO programs are inherently political or are directly threatened by these regulations, organizations rely on their instrumental flexibility to avoid changing to their core missions.
