Why divided up? Why those organizations?

Why these issue areas? Why freedom of expression as hard case, education as easy case? History of the two issues, different UDHR articles

Index on Censorship includes section on anti-authoritarian lobbying (at least in 2015 annual report)


Internews claims to work locally:

> We have a local focus, believing that news and information created by and for the local community has the biggest impact on people’s day-to-day lives

IMS has an actual document about working in different political contexts, including a section on authoritarian countries and repressive regimes. They have a table showing what they do in each type of regime
