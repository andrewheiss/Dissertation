Gatekeeping regulations provide repressive governments with tools to filter out unwanted international NGOs and reduce the effectiveness of the organizations they allow in their country. Rules that emphasize gatekeeping are defensive and allow regimes to balance and control the constellation of political institutions they face. Repressive governments are not limited to regulatory defense, though. Governments can take advantage of the foreign organizations working in their countries and use their services to boost their own public image at home and abroad. The presence of foreign organizations in failed states can signal growing stability and instill confidence in potential investors. For example, an education INGO working in East Africa reports:

> The [g]overnment is desperately seeking any form of cooperation with foreign countries to re-establish a resemblance of normality in a war-ravaged country that is slowly trying to lift off. Therefore any international action is warmly welcomed by top brass executives of any political side.[^1]

The presence of foreign NGOs can also act as a signal of compliance with international norms to domestic audiences. INGOs provide specialized services and expertise that are often not offered by domestic firms or local governments. Government ministries tend to partner with INGOs "whenever they need… services"[^2] to take advantage of improved services and to access better resources. One disaster relief INGO working in South Asia reports having a close and productive relationship with the government, since it "has recognized how quickly and efficiently our nonprofit was able to provide relief services and has supported partnerships with us in many areas related to our programs of health, education and [disaster] recovery."[^3] Finally, government officials will also use foreign NGO services and expertise for personal political gain—a public health INGO working in West Africa notes that "some state officials want your services to be in their home villages and community"[^4] as a form of pork barrel politics, securing aid and services for their constituents, while an education INGO reports that the Latin American government they work with generally ignores them, except during elections, when "politicians will visit the partner we work with for photo ops."[^5]

Governments can reap the benefits of international NGOs by employing regulations designed both to (1) capture the resources and programmatic outputs of INGO activities and (2) co-opt INGOs to act more amenably to regime preferences. In contrast with gatekeeping laws, regulations focused on program capture *are* designed to distort INGO missions, reducing the distance between the two parties' ideal points by nudging the INGO's core values closer to the government's preferences (see @fig:theory-regulation-purpose). 

TODO: governments attempt program capture with regulations related to oversight and operations. Effects on INGOs: Laws lock INGOs into their programs, change their missions; make them pawns in greater political game within country

As with gatekeeping restrictions, the level of regulatory pressure on INGOs depends on the contentiousness of their relationship with the government. 


¶ explaining pressure + responses/flexibility
Education, low contention organizations don't tend to worry about this as much - scope condition = high contention
They're mostly focused on just doing their mission - priority isn't taking on government, it's helping people

- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious and/or when flexibility is limited, organizations will be more likely to align their missions with the government and explicitly shape their programs to match government objectives. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will act more strategically to protect against changes: choosing regulatory body, using more/fewer local/foreign staff - fund irregularly, channel funds through domestic partners, work in exile
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes

# Nonprofit mission evolution and the importance of agency

Before looking at how governments work to capture INGO programs and how organizations respond and react to these attempts, a brief discussion of nonprofit mission evolution is helpful. Nonprofit missions can and should evolve in response to changes in the institutional environment, including revisions to government regulations, shifting donor preferences, and developments in stakeholder needs. Successful nonprofit strategy is "contingent on appropriate interpretation of environmental conditions and formulating an organizational response to address those conditions" [@Brown:2010, 207; @Mintzberg:1979; @Moore:2000]. To be effective, strategic evolution must take external trends and political developments into account [@Bryson:2010; @PoisterStreib:1999]. Importantly, changes in strategy should be purposeful and aligned with organizational values [@Scheimann:2009]. Survey respondents describe a variety of reasons for strategically shifting and refining their core missions over time. Organizations report that they "respond to issues in society,"[^6] "change our programming based on the needs and suggestions of the villagers"[^7] and "flex our priorities and reorganize in accordance with the immediate needs at the time they had arisen,"[^8] strategically changing their core missions to better align with the social environment and needs of their stakeholders. 

Others change their missions in response to shifting donor demands. Sometimes this involves a minor retooling of programs. For instance, organizations that previously received funding from large development IGOs like USAID, DFID, and UN agencies restructured their programs focused on accomplishing the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to instead target the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that form the foundation of the UN's anti-poverty 2030 Agenda.[^9] Aligning with donor preferences can also require more substantial programmatic changes—one respondent laments, "I hope we evolve to meet changing needs, but, alas, we also evolve to meet changing donor priorities."[^10] Despite organizations' attempts to strategically respond to stakeholder needs, donor priorities are often more salient and receive higher priority, leading to mission drift [@Jones:2007]. 

Adapting to stakeholder and donor demands is not an insurmountable challenge, as both parties' preferences are generally aligned with INGO missions—though their priorities might shift, donors concerned with prosocial issues tend to remain focused on similar issues.  Additionally, INGOs typically voluntarily choose to respond to changes in their environments, and organizations maintain a degree of agency when designing their strategies. However, when working in repressive political contexts where government and INGO preferences are not aligned, conscientious strategic planning becomes more difficult and the threat of externally-imposed mission drift looms larger. Maintaining agency is more difficult, and changes in programming can be brought about involuntarily. Not only do authoritarian regulations serve to limit *access* to INGO target countries, as shown in the previous chapter, these laws are also designed to distort the *missions* of their guest INGOs and reshape them in the government's favor. In order to gain or maintain access to the country, INGOs can reshape their goals and missions to align better with their host governments' preferences: one highly contentious conflict resolution INGO working in Southeast Asia restructures its mission to maintain legal status in its host country, explaining that "[w]e have to comply with regustration regulations, and have to provide information / shape our programme to be able to be registered [sic]."[^11] Making these changes can conflict with INGO core values and result in a loss of control or agency over their strategies. Repressive governments are aware of this and can structure their regulatory environments in a way that allows them to co-opt or capture the programs of their foreign guests. Governments and INGOs thus find themselves in a state of amicable contempt, adding an extra dimension to the challenge of strategically adapting to the political environment.


# Resource capture: regulating funding and resources

First, governments use regulations to capture and control INGO funding. Resource-focused restrictions are as common as restrictions on registration—only a third of responding organizations report not feeling any effects of resource-related laws (see @fig:regs-faced-capture).[^12] By regulating and limiting access to funds, governments are able to directly target a crucial element of instrumental flexibility—a diversity of reliable revenue streams lends INGOs stability, and losing access to those streams can pressure organizations to become more aligned with government preferences. 

![Severity of program capture regulations, divided by contentiousness](../../Output/figures/5-regs-faced-capture){#fig:regs-faced-capture}

At first glance, regulations aimed at limiting funding and resources appear to be related to gatekeeping, since controlling revenue sources can reduce an organization's level of instrumental flexibility and can allow regimes to restrict INGO access to their countries. However, funding regulations are more likely to target organizational values and coerce changes in programming and strategy. In some cases, some respondents hesitantly reported that they had changed the issues they worked on and become more friendly with government demands in response to laws dealing with financial regulation and foreign donations.[^13] Much more commonly, though, government oversight over resources enables regimes to extract monetary benefits from guest INGOs and co-opt their activities for political gain. Attempts to co-opt or capture resources and revenue challenge core organizational values, and in their responses to these regulations, INGOs focus more on protecting their missions than on maintaining access to the country.

Governments can use regulations to directly capture resources by channelling money from INGOs into regime coffers. As one human rights organization in Central Africa notes, many restrictive states act as though "international [organizations] do not have the right to grant a certain amount of funds without passing through them,"[^14] and accordingly, states structure their regulatory environment in ways that encourage the capture of foreign money. According to survey respondents, strict laws related to resources—that notably need not be designed specifically with NGOs in mind—are the first step in a chain of events that allow restrictive governments to potentially seize resources and compromise organizational values. 

First, governments use both (1) indirect regulations such as import controls and payroll taxes, and (2) laws directly targeted at NGO funding sources as a method for imposing financial inefficiencies to slow down INGO activities and skim from their resources. These types of resource-related laws place pressure on low contention organizations that focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, since governments are better able to tap into the raw materials that these organizations deal with. For example, a humanitarian assistance INGO working the Caribbean describes how import laws limiting foreign goods impose substantial obstacles on their activities, stating that it "[c]osts money while waiting for containers of goods to clear customs and the processing of our annual report that includes our Import List, which must be pre-approved annually taking months for approval delays our shipments and customs clearance even more."[^15] A development organization in East Africa faces similar laws restricting imports: "Imported resources are heavily taxed even though the resources are targeting vulnerable communities in the country. Rather than making things easier for such work, legal obstacles are put forth."[^16] Employment laws can also adversely affect international NGOs. One organization working in Latin America notes that government-mandated pay increases and changes in employee benefits for local staff "hurt us financially and results in the need to raise more funds while at the same time cutting costs in some areas,"[^17] while one working in the Caribbean explains that compulsory contributions to state social security and insurance schemes impose unnecessary costs and inefficiencies for their local employees.[^18] 

More prominent than these indirect types of resource-focused regulations, though, are laws limiting foreign funding for NGOs. Since the late 2000s, many countries have passed laws severely limiting or banning funding from foreign donors. This emphasis on foreign funding laws is warranted—as discussed above, registration laws can be benign and do not necessarily adversely affect INGOs, and restrictions on assembly and speech target a specific subset of advocacy- and politics-oriented INGOs that non-contentious NGOs. Foreign funding laws, on the other hand, explicitly limit foreign influence on domestic activities and cause direct harm to all international NGOs, which are internationally funded by definition. Perhaps more than any other factor, the international community's focus on a global crackdown on civil society gained prominence in response to laws that specifically targeted foreign funding and connections, including Russia's 2012 Foreign Agents law, China's 2017 Foreign NGO law, and Egypt's 2017 anti-NGO law. Foreign funding laws have an obvious gatekeeping function, and in previous chapters I showed that authoritarian regimes use them in concert with the de facto civil society regulatory environment to control which INGOs are allowed in the country. Organizations working in highly repressive regimes are often prohibited from contacting international organizations and can face "prosecution for receiving foreign aid and cooperation with international NGOs."[^19] Governments are also suspicious of foreign funding "in part because they know terror groups receive funding this way, but also because they look down upon any outside influences."[^20] @Chaudhry:2016, @DupuyRonPrakash:2015, and @DupuyRonPrakash:2016 find similar results: states overwhelmingly take political concerns into account when deciding to limit the activities of NGOs. 

In addition to their gatekeeping goals, foreign funding laws are also designed to co-opt NGO programs and capture NGO resources. Many governments create avenues—both legal and extralegal—for non-contentious organizations to receive foreign funds, but according to respondents, these roads allow the government to be "unjustly confiscatory"[^21] and can redirect funds from NGOs to the government. Transferring foreign funds to the government can happen at a formal, de jure level. Similar to the Russian Public Chamber system, which forces NGOs to channel all resources through a government agency, respondents note that working through India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) is the only way to legally obtain foreign money. The FCRA allows the government to dictate which organizations can receive money and gives it the ability to seize or freeze the assets of unwanted organizations, thus capturing NGO resources [@press-trust-india:2015].[^22] 

Transfers to the government can also happen at an informal level. Respondents report that government officials in authoritarian regimes "solicit for opportunities to benefit unconditionally from international NGO resources";[^23] for many INGOs that rely on foreign funds, "either you give the government money or you are out."[^24] The inefficiencies imposed by resource-related laws lead to the second step in the process for capturing resources and compromising values: the temptation to turn to extralegal methods for avoiding delays. An INGO working in the Caribbean reports that "every regulation or law gives a potential pretext for an official or policeman to attempt to solicit a bribe."[^25] These bribes and side payments act as "speed money," [@Bardhan:1997, 1323] allowing organizations to dodge bureaucratic hurdles while simultaneously allowing regime officials to take foreign money. 

However, enriching repressive governments and using informal and illegal backchannels to avoid inefficiencies can challenge INGOs' core values. Several respondents reported that they resist efforts to co-opt their organizations through corruption and capture, but that the resistance hurts the effectiveness of their missions. For instance, a disaster relief INGO working in South Asia notes "[t]here is a lot of bureaucracy and corruption. We spend so much time to get approval in the projects[.] We don’t agree to pay bribe, which makes or work even more difficult [sic]"[^26]—the organization's reluctance to accede to overtures of corruption means that they are stuck with inefficiencies. An development INGO working in the Caribbean describes how avoiding contact with inefficient and expensive bureaucrats directly conflicts with their values:

> We are supposed to be signed up for [national social security], however all the workers want no part of it because they say that people pay in, but nobody can ever collect payment unless they are friends with a senator. We have not signed up, and are therefore out of compliance with the law. There is also … [national] employee medical [insurance]. If an employer pays into that, the employees have to go to [government] hospitals and can’t receive care otherwise. The closest hospital is 90 minutes away and has 1 doctor. The employees asked if they could please stick with the current system, which is simply that the organization directly manages care and pays all bills for work related injuries. *We are out of compliance, and in principle I don’t like being out of compliance.*[^27]

This organization's struggle to balance its preference to avoid government corruption and bottlenecks against its preference to comply with government regulations is emblematic of regimes' larger effort to encourage shifts in INGO missions through co-optation and control. Resource regulations purposely create inefficiencies to force INGOs to funnel additional money through their host governments, which in turn potentially distorts INGO values. In the end, this INGO chose to not comply with government demands for control and co-optation, but in exchange, the scope of their programming is inherently more limited as the organization avoids all contact with the government and hides its activities as much as possible.

The pressure to concede to government demands is particularly strong for non-contentious organizations: import controls, bribes, and employment regulations target organizations that have a physical presence in the country and that deal with physical goods like aid and development supplies. Unlike their high-contention counterparts, these types of organizations are generally less concerned with forcing political changes and are therefore more likely to follow government regulations and allow for some degree of capture. INGOs with low instrumental flexibility—those with few employees, few sources of revenue, and limited partnerships—are especially prone to threats of co-optation and capture. 

Many small, low-contention respondents indicated that they had changed their funding structure to allow for increased government control. Several reported that they had begun receiving funding directly from government offices (similar to Russia's Public Chamber system), either channeling foreign donations through those offices or receiving government money directly.[^28] Another explained that they "looked more within [their host country] and less for funding support linked to foreign [donors]" in response to stricter laws related to funding and employment.[^29] Organizations are often aware that partnering with the government can lead to resource and program capture, but with limited resources, they are unable to avoid it—INGOs must spend "a lot of [time and money] to organzie [sic] so as to not be covered by the regs.[^30] Rather than fight against regulations, low flexibility organizations reluctantly follow along in pursuit of their mission.

Organizations can limit the degree of capture they face, though, by drawing on their flexibility. One agricultural assistance INGO working in Central Africa complained that "[w]e are supposed to partner with government services in the field, but they have no budgets and no vision." Regardless, the organization pays the necessary fees to bureaucrats and funnels money through specified government channels, in compliance with regulations. As expected, this money disappears and their government partners "do not deliver invoices to prove their expenses," since "[m]ost of the time they are only looking for control over the means and predating on the income of the farmers or of any kind of economic activity" by guest INGOs.[^31] At first glance, it appears that bureaucrats successfully capture a portion of the INGO's resources and limit their effectiveness in the country. However, because the organization has a high degree of flexibility—dozens of staff members in their home country, hundreds of volunteers in their target countries, and substantial funding from large UN agencies—it moves around the country to remote areas far from the capital, where capture and co-optation would be more severe. The INGO is able to draw on its resources to optimize their various in-country headquarters to minimize the amount of money bureaucrats can take. 

An education INGO working in East Africa follows a similar strategy and operates in remote and neglected areas of the country without consent from the country's Ministry of Education. The organization is happy to do so to avoid capture: "We think it’s better like that, because if we ask for permission, we should certenly pay a lot (admistrative fees for nothing !) [sic]."[^32] This INGO differs from the organization that allowed a modicum of capture, though, in the amount of flexibility it enjoys. While the organization in Central Africa has a large budget backed by prominent IGOs, the organization in East Africa receives the bulk of its funding from individual and corporate donors, which have been volatile revenue streams, with many donors ending their support following the financial crisis of 2008–09. As a result, the organization is unable to afford the necessary minimum administrative fees or bribes to merit increased access to the country, thus reducing the "visibility and recognition" of its work in the country. The organization gladly protects against captured revenue and coerced changes to its programs, but without sufficient flexibility in revenue, it remains on the margins.

When facing laws that increase government control of resources, INGOs can adjust how they fund their work to prevent capture. A humanitarian assistance INGO working in a Middle Eastern country that taxes large foreign transfers avoids these additional fees by funding their organization irregularly and in smaller tranches, effectively hiding these transfers from government bureaucrats on the lookout for consistently large sums of money.[^33] Other organizations limit the amount of money their in-country offices handle and instead "transfer funds to activists and other NGOs within the country."[^34] Transferring money to other actors helps the INGO stay off the government's radar, but it is also limiting for organizations with fewer resources. One human rights organization working in Southeast Asia sends the majority of its money to activists, but it struggles to maintain regular funding streams. The INGO only has one employee that deals with fundraising, with "no one behind the [employee[ to support his work, or to succeed him if he leaves the organization with some institutional knowledge." Assigning all the organization's fundraising efforts to one person, especially when much of the funding cannot be retained in the INGO itself because of the organization's strategy of avoiding funding restrictions "makes it difficult to accomplish current goals or to plan for the future." With greater funding and flexibility, the organization could better avoid restrictions and "accomplish significantly more work."[^35]

# Managerial capture: regulating oversight

Approximately three fourths of respondents indicated that they face moderate to substantial restrictions on their operations once they are set up in their host countries (see @fig:regs-faced-capture).[^36] One common form of operational restriction occurs through oversight regulation, which allows governments to weigh in on INGO programming and influence their programs. Governments are can be closely—and sometimes directly—involved in INGO management, particularly in authoritarian contexts. The left panel of @fig:freq-both shows that organizations working in both types of regimes tend to be in fairly regular contact with the government, with the majority of INGOs meeting with officials at some level of government at least once a year. This diverges from how often INGOs claim to be required to submit formal reports to the government in the right panel of @fig:freq-both. The majority of organizations working in democracies—roughly 40% of all respondents—do not have any official reporting requirements, while a little over 15% of organizations working in democracies are required to report annually. In contrast, organizations that target autocracies are far less likely to not need to report, generally must check in at least annually with the government, and are more likely to need to report more than once a year. Autocracies thus have a heavier hand in INGO affairs, requiring more formal reporting and oversight than their democratic counterparts.

![Frequency of contact with government and formal reporting to government](../../Output/figures/3-freq-both){#fig:freq-both}

In addition to demanding oversight through reporting, one common method states use to manage international NGOs is to position government officials within the governance structures of these organizations. In the previous case study on China, I described how the Chinese government now requires that all international NGOs have a formal sponsor from the Communist Party. Many responding organizations report similar arrangements in their countries. In Eastern Europe, an MP who chairs the education committee personally monitors the educational programming of one INGO,[^37] a foreign affairs minister works directly with an education INGO in South America,[^38] and the former president of a European nation is a member of and consults for a human rights INGO, representing the diplomatic interests of their country through the NGO's programming.[^39] It is unclear what the consequences of going against government preferences when officials are so closely involved in INGO decisions—few respondents with bureaucrats and politicians in their organizations opted to describe what might happen. However, a human rights INGO working in East Africa explained that officials "could close down the project" if government demands are not met.[^40]

Regulations can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming even without formal participation in governance. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^41] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^42] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^43] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.

Finally, regulations regarding INGO management and operations can inadvertently give governments control over some aspects of their advocacy and programming, in particular when regulations do not map directly onto INGO strategies. An orphanage working in Central Asia provides a helpful example. The organization's host country requires that all international NGOs dealing with orphans guarantee full funding for each child for a full calendar year, beginning in January each year. This rule provides stability for the country's foreign-supported orphans and gives the government the ability to lock in and capture INGO programming. In accordance with the host country's requirements that orphans be funded for a full calendar year, the INGO encourages its private and corporate donors to sponsor children for a full twelve months, but donors can donate at any time during the year (not just in January), and donors "may pull out of their sponsorship at anytime of the year." When sponsorships dry up or appear irregularly, the organization faces difficult financial decisions:

> We are not allowed by the … government to withdraw the names of orphans sponsored until the end of each year even if we did not receive funding for that orphan but we still must pay for that orphan until the end of each year.[^44]

This regulation puts substantial strain on the organization's resources and allows the government to force the orphanage to dip into its general fund to guarantee its services. Other respondents report similar instances where host governments use bureaucratic delays and rules to lock INGOs into their programs—significant delays in different stages of project approval force an INGO working in South Asia to "keep the project running without the funds. We need to use our limited NGO resource to implement the project."[^45] This indirect form of control allows the government to guarantee access to INGO services regardless of donor cash flow, but imposes significant financial burdens on those organizations. 

How INGOs respond to government attempts to become involved in organizational decisions depends on their reserves of instrumental flexibility. In the absence of reliable funding, well-trained staff, or support from larger organizations, INGOs can involuntarily shift their programming in the the regime's favor. The Central Asian orphanage is locked into its programs because it cannot control donor behavior and has no other consistent streams of income, while other organizations deplete their limited budgets to keep projects active, again because of a lack of flexibility in revenue. 

As they do in response to other types of regulation, INGOs can hide within or withdraw from from the country to avoid more direct managerial capture. Doing so, however, requires additional resources to pay for relocation and remote management. For instance, an INGO advocating for HIV patients in Southern Africa faced recurrent "[p]olitical intrusion and manipulation from [a] local Member of Parliament," which led the organization to "be more selective on focus locations" and move its offices to avoid managerial oversight.[^46] This regular relocation puts financial strain on the INGO, though, and makes it difficult to "hav[e] enough finances and resources" to undertake their work—maintaining instrumental flexibility remains a challenge for the organization. In another case, a children's rights and education INGO in India works from abroad to avoid managerial capture. To register as an international NGO, the organization would need to have "a fully Indian board of directors,"[^47] which would open it up to indirect government control (with bureaucrats on the local board). To prevent this type of capture, the INGO is registered as a "liaison office," which prohibits direct implementation of activities, but permits direct collaboration with domestic NGOs. Working in exile requires that the organization spend considerable time managing its domestic partners while simultaneously maintaining contacts with oversight authorities to ensure that its collaboration remains legal. Because it is funded primarily by grants from its home government, the INGO has enough financial resources to dedicate staff time to remotely manage its myriad in-country partnerships—without this flexibility, the organization would likely struggle to effectively operate from abroad.

Having bureaucrats involved in organizational decision making does not always disadvantage INGOs. @Teets:2014 has shown that INGOs working in China systematically shop for the optimal oversight agency, work carefully to build positive relationships with their local officials, and seek to provide tangible benefits for their government sponsors by providing needed services and offering crucial expertise. INGO respondents confirm this finding, with many describing their efforts to cultivate relationships with politicians and bureaucrats. A human rights INGO working in Western Africa learned that the current and former ministers of justice were both personally opposed to the death penalty. The organization built rapport with the ministry and provided information, tools, and advice to the ministers to help them work toward national abolition of the death penalty. These close connections have subsequently helped the INGO obtain legal status in the country. In 2016, one of the INGO's local partner organizations faced a noticeably smooth registration process because of its work with the government, and as a result, the larger organization has faced little pressure to tone down their abolition efforts.[^48] 

As explained in the previous chapter, one common reaction to gatekeeping regulations is to outsource compliance with those laws to domestic partners who can deal with labor, tax, and other regulatory issues required to enter and stay in the country. INGOs follow a similar strategy to protect against managerial capture by stacking their local offices with staff who are the most knowledgable and best positioned to work with the organization's assigned government liaisons. At one extreme, a European human rights INGO working in East Africa purposely does not employ European staff in its country offices due to concerns of protecting foreign staff safety when working with bureaucrats. Instead, the organization ensures that only locals "deal with the government official [sic]," since they are most aware of the dangers of doing so.[^49] 

More commonly, INGOs outsource their operations to local staff in response to increased managerial oversight not out of concerns of safety, but to improve their relationship with their host governments and improve their chances of program success. A youth development organization working in the Middle East reports that the government is "not really trusting of youth organizations, especially international organizations." To overcome this trust gap, the organization purposely increases its contact with the government officials tasked with its oversight. The INGO relies on a local team to contact and lobby the government and ensures that officials are invited "to be a part of our programs."[^50] Other INGOs pursue similar strategies, inviting government staff, officials, police, and judges to serve in advisory positions on specific projects and programs and encouraging bureaucrats to participate in stakeholder meetings, with the explicit goal of increasing their influence and standing with key decision makers.[^51]

Cultivating relationships with government officials requires time and resources. Thus, when they enjoy sufficient flexibility and are able to make consistent and positive contact with oversight agencies, INGOs can harness and shape direct government involvement in their favor, pushing back against—and even reversing—regime attempts to shift or tame organizational missions and ideals. In the absence of flexibility, though, INGOs are more likely to find themselves locked into expensive programming that benefits the host regime or  come under direct government management.

[^36]:	As with resource and funding restrictions, the probability that the difference in proportion of high and low contention INGOs is greater than zero is low or null for all of the possible levels of operations restrictions: high contention organizations lean toward more substantial pressure ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.21$) but there is no substantial difference between high and low contention organizations feeling moderate ($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.68$) or no restrictions($P(\Delta > 0) = 0.52$). All posterior probabilities are available in @tbl:regs-differences-capture-p in the appendix.
