# Encouraging shifts in INGO missions through program capture

control and co-optation

TODO: A couple paragraphs outlining:

- Theoretical form of regulation (see capture part of @fig:theory-regulation-purpose): Host governments constrict the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to target INGO missions and capture the benefits from their work or coerce INGO missions to be more amenable to regime preferences
- Effects on INGOs: Laws lock INGOs into their programs, change their missions; make them pawns in greater political game within country
- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious and/or when flexibility is limited, organizations will be more likely to align their missions with the government and explicitly shape their programs to match government objectives. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will act more strategically to protect against changes: choosing regulatory body, using more/fewer local/foreign staff, moving to a different country - fund irregularly, channel funds through domestic partners, work in exile, avoid fees
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes

Is shifting bad?

Nonprofit missions can and should evolve in response to changes in the institutional environment, including revisions to government regulations, shifting donor preferences, and developments in stakeholder needs. Successful nonprofit strategy is "contingent on appropriate interpretation of environmental conditions and formulating an organizational response to address those conditions" [@Brown:2010, 207; @Mintzberg:1979; @Moore:2000]. To be effective, strategic evolution must take external trends and political developments into account [@Bryson:2010; @PoisterStreib:1999] and must be purposeful and aligned with organizational values [@Scheimann:2009]. Survey respondents describe a variety of reasons for strategically shifting and refining their core missions over time. Organizations report that they "respond to issues in society,"[^1] "change our programming based on the needs and suggestions of the villagers"[^2] and "flex our priorities and reorganize in accordance with the immediate needs at the time they had arisen,"[^3] strategically changing their core missions to better align with the social environment and needs of their stakeholders. 

Others change their missions in response to shifting donor demands. Sometimes this involves a minor retooling of programs. For instance, organizations that previously received funding from large development IGOs like USAID, DFID, and UN agencies restructured their programs focused on accomplishing the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to instead target the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that form the foundation of the UN's anti-poverty 2030 Agenda.[^4] Aligning with donor preferences can also require more substantial programmatic changes—one respondent laments, "I hope we evolve to meet changing needs, but, alas, we also evolve to meet changing donor priorities."[^5] Despite organizations' attempts to strategically respond to stakeholder needs, donor priorities are often more salient and receive higher priority, leading to mission drift [@Jones:2007]. 

Adapting to stakeholder and donor demands is not an insurmountable challenge, as both parties' preferences are generally aligned with INGO missions. However, when working in repressive political contexts, conscientious strategic planning becomes more difficult. Not only do authoritarian regulations serve to limit *access* to INGO target countries, as shown in the previous chapter, these laws are also designed to distort the *missions* of their guest INGOs and reshape them in the government's favor. In order to gain or maintain access to the country, INGOs can reshape their goals and missions to align better with their host governments' preferences: one highly contentious conflict resolution INGO working in Southeast Asia restructures its mission to maintain legal status in its host country, explaining that "[w]e have to comply with regustration regulations, and have to provide information / shape our programme to be able to be registered [sic]."[^6] However, making these changes can conflict with INGO core values and result in a loss of control or agency over their strategies. Governments are aware of this and can structure their regulatory environments in a way that allows them to co-opt or capture the programs of their foreign guests. Governments and INGOs thus find themselves in a state of amicable contempt, adding an extra dimension to the challenge of strategically adapting to the political environment.


## Why capture programs?

Though fears of regime stability appear paramount in determining the relationship between INGOs and governments, the relationship between INGOs and their host governments is not always so antagonistic. Governments often take advantage of the foreign organizations working in their countries, using their presence and their services to boost their own public image at home and abroad. The presence of foreign organizations in failed states can signal growing stability and instill confidence in potential investors. For example, an education INGO working in East Africa reports:

> The [g]overnment is desperately seeking any form of cooperation with foreign countries to re-establish a resemblance of normality in a war-ravaged country that is slowly trying to lift off. Therefore any international action is warmly welcomed by top brass executives of any political side.[^7]

The presence of foreign NGOs can also act as a signal of compliance with international norms to domestic audiences. INGOs provide specialized services and expertise that are often not offered by domestic firms or local governments. Government ministries tend to partner with INGOs "whenever they need… services"[^8] to take advantage of improved services and to access better resources. One disaster relief INGO working in South Asia reports having a close and productive relationship with the government, since it "has recognized how quickly and efficiently our nonprofit was able to provide relief services and has supported partnerships with us in many areas related to our programs of health, education and [disaster] recovery."[^9] Government officials will also use foreign NGO services and expertise for personal political gain—a public health INGO working in West Africa notes that "some state officials want your services to be in their home villages and community"[^10] as a form of pork barrel politics, securing aid and services for their constituents, while an education INGO reports that the Latin American government they work with generally ignores them, except during elections, when "politicians will visit the partner we work with for photo ops."[^11]

Most importantly, however, governments 

TODO: Short ¶ outlining the rest of this section—governments attempt program capture with regulations related to oversight and operations.

Control and co-optation


## Resource capture: regulating funding and resources

Governments use legislation and regulations to control INGO funding. Resource-focused restrictions are as common as restrictions on registration—only a third of responding organizations report not feeling any effects of resource-related laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping). By regulating and limiting access to funds, governments are able to directly target a crucial element of instrumental flexibility—a diversity of reliable revenue streams lends INGOs stability, and losing access to those streams can impose substantial burdens on organizations. At first glance, regulations aimed at limiting funding and resources appear to be related to gatekeeping, since controlling the revenue sources can reduce an organization's level of instrumental flexibility and can allow regimes to restrict INGO access to their countries. Importantly, however, government oversight over resources enables regimes to extract monetary benefits from guest INGOs and co-opt their activities for political gain. Attempts to co-opt or capture resources and revenue challenge core organizational values, and in their responses to these regulations, INGOs focus more on protecting their missions than on maintaining access to the country.

Governments can use regulations to directly capture resources by channelling money from INGOs into regime coffers. As one human rights organization in Central Africa notes, many restrictive states act as though "international [organizations] do not have the right to grant a certain amount of funds without passing through them,"[^12] and accordingly, states structure their regulatory environment in ways that encourage the capture of foreign money. According to survey respondents, strict laws related to resources—that notably need not be designed specifically with NGOs in mind—are the first step in a chain of events that allow restrictive governments to potentially seize resources and compromise organizational values. 

First, governments use both (1) indirect regulations such as import controls and payroll taxes, and (2) laws directly targeted at NGO funding sources as a method for imposing financial inefficiencies to slow down INGO activities and skim from their resources. For example, a humanitarian assistance INGO working the Caribbean describes how import laws limiting foreign goods impose substantial obstacles on their activities, stating that it "[c]osts money while waiting for containers of goods to clear customs and the processing of our annual report that includes our Import List, which must be pre-approved annually taking months for approval delays our shipments and customs clearance even more."[^13] A development organization in East Africa faces similar laws restricting imports: "Imported resources are heavily taxed even though the resources are targeting vulnerable communities in the country. Rather than making things easier for such work, legal obstacles are put forth."[^14] Employment laws can also adversely affect international NGOs. One organization working in Latin America notes that government-mandated pay increases and changes in employee benefits for local staff "hurt us financially and results in the need to raise more funds while at the same time cutting costs in some areas,"[^15] while one working in the Caribbean explains that compulsory contributions to state social security and insurance schemes impose unnecessary costs and inefficiencies for their local employees.[^16]

More prominent than these indirect types of resource-focused regulations, though, are laws limiting foreign funding for NGOs. Since the late 2000s, many countries have passed laws severely limiting or banning funding from foreign donors. This emphasis on foreign funding laws is warranted—as discussed above, registration laws can be benign and do not necessarily adversely affect INGOs, and restrictions on assembly and speech target a specific subset of advocacy- and politics-oriented INGOs that non-contentious NGOs. Foreign funding laws, on the other hand, explicitly limit foreign influence on domestic activities and cause direct harm to all international NGOs, which are internationally funded by definition. Perhaps more than any other factor, the international community's focus on a global crackdown on civil society gained prominence in response to laws that specifically targeted foreign funding and connections, including Russia's 2012 Foreign Agents law, China's 2017 Foreign NGO law, and Egypt's 2017 anti-NGO law. Foreign funding laws have an obvious gatekeeping function, and in previous chapters I showed that authoritarian regimes use them in concert with the de facto civil society regulatory environment to control which INGOs are allowed in the country. Organizations working in highly repressive regimes are often prohibited from contacting international organizations and can face "prosecution for receiving foreign aid and cooperation with international NGOs."[^17] Governments are also suspicious of foreign funding "in part because they know terror groups receive funding this way, but also because they look down upon any outside influences."[^18] @Chaudhry:2016, @DupuyRonPrakash:2015, and @DupuyRonPrakash:2016 find similar results: states overwhelmingly take political concerns into account when deciding to limit the activities of NGOs. 

In addition to their gatekeeping goals, foreign funding laws are also designed to co-opt NGO programs and capture NGO resources. Many governments create avenues—both legal and extralegal—for non-contentious organizations to receive foreign funds, but according to respondents, these roads allow the government to be "unjustly confiscatory"[^19] and can redirect funds from NGOs to the government. Transferring foreign funds to the government can happen at a formal, de jure level. Similar to the Russian Public Chamber system, which forces NGOs to channel all resources through a government agency, respondents note that working through India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) is the only way to legally obtain foreign money. The FCRA allows the government to dictate which organizations can receive money and gives it the ability to seize or freeze the assets of unwanted organizations, thus capturing NGO resources [@press-trust-india:2015].[^20] 

Transfers can also happen at an informal level. Respondents report that government officials in authoritarian regimes "solicit for opportunities to benefit unconditionally from international NGO resources";[^21] for many INGOs that rely on foreign funds, "either you give the government money or you are out."[^22] The inefficiencies imposed by resource-related laws lead to the second step in the process for capturing resources and compromising values: the temptation to turn to extralegal methods for avoiding delays. An INGO working in the Caribbean reports that "every regulation or law gives a potential pretext for an official or policeman to attempt to solicit a bribe."[^23] These bribes and side payments act as "speed money," [@Bardhan:1997, 1323] allowing organizations to dodge bureaucratic hurdles while simultaneously allowing regime officials to take foreign money. 

However, enriching repressive governments and using informal and illegal backchannels to avoid inefficiencies can challenge INGOs' core values. Several respondents reported that they resist efforts to co-opt their organizations through corruption and capture, but that the resistance hurts the effectiveness of their missions. For instance, a disaster relief INGO working in South Asia notes "[t]here is a lot of bureaucracy and corruption. We spend so much time to get approval in the projects[.] We don’t agree to pay bribe, which makes or work even more difficult [sic]"[^24]—the organization's reluctance to accede to overtures of corruption means that they are stuck with inefficiencies. An development INGO working in the Caribbean describes how avoiding contact with inefficient and expensive bureaucrats directly conflicts with their values:

> We are supposed to be signed up for [national social security], however all the workers want no part of it because they say that people pay in, but nobody can ever collect payment unless they are friends with a senator. We have not signed up, and are therefore out of compliance with the law. There is also … [national] employee medical [insurance]. If an employer pays into that, the employees have to go to [government] hospitals and can’t receive care otherwise. The closest hospital is 90 minutes away and has 1 doctor. The employees asked if they could please stick with the current system, which is simply that the organization directly manages care and pays all bills for work related injuries. *We are out of compliance, and in principle I don’t like being out of compliance.*[^25]

This organization's struggle to balance its preference to avoid government corruption and bottlenecks against its preference to comply with government regulations is emblematic of regimes' larger effort to encourage shifts in INGO missions through co-optation and control. Resource regulations purposely create inefficiencies to force INGOs to funnel additional money through their host governments, which in turn potentially distorts INGO values.

## Managerial capture: regulating oversight

Governments are can be closely—and sometimes directly—involved in INGO programming, particularly in authoritarian contexts. The left panel of @fig:freq-both shows that organizations working in both types of regimes tend to be in fairly regular contact with the government, with the majority of INGOs meeting with officials at some level of government at least once a year. This diverges from how often INGOs claim to be required to submit formal reports to the government in the right panel of @fig:freq-both. The majority of organizations working in democracies—roughly 40% of all respondents—do not have any official reporting requirements, while a little over 15% of organizations working in democracies are required to report annually. In contrast, organizations that target autocracies are far less likely to not need to report, generally must check in at least annually with the government, and are more likely to need to report more than once a year. Autocracies thus have a heavier hand in INGO affairs, requiring more formal reporting and oversight than their democratic counterparts.

![Frequency of contact with government and formal reporting to government](../../Output/figures/3-freq-both){#fig:freq-both}

In addition to demanding oversight through reporting, one common method states use to manage international NGOs is to position government officials within the governance structures of these organizations. The case study on China in the previous chapter described how the Chinese government now requires that all international NGOs have a formal sponsor from the Communist Party. Many responding organizations report similar arrangements in their countries. In Eastern Europe, an MP who chairs the education committee personally monitors the educational programming of one INGO,[^26] a foreign affairs minister works directly with an education INGO in South America,[^27] and the former president of a European nation is a member of and consults for a human rights INGO, representing the diplomatic interests of their country through the NGO's programming.[^28] It is unclear what the consequences of going against government preferences when officials are so closely involved in INGO decisions—few respondents with bureaucrats and politicians in their organizations opted to describe what might happen. However, a human rights INGO working in East Africa explained that officials "could close down the project" if government demands are not met.[^29]

Regulations can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming even without formal participation in governance. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^30] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^31] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^32] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.  

Notably, however, having bureaucrats involved in organizational decision making  does not always disadvantage INGOs. @Teets:2014 has shown that INGOs working in China systematically shop for the optimal oversight agency, work carefully to build positive relationships with their local officials, and seek to provide tangible benefits for their government sponsors by providing needed services and offering crucial expertise. INGO respondents confirm this finding, with many describing their efforts to cultivate relationships with politicians and bureaucrats. A human rights INGO working in Western Africa learned that the current and former ministers of justice were both personally opposed to the death penalty. The organization built rapport with the ministry and provided information, tools, and advice to the ministers to help them work toward national abolition of the death penalty. These close connections have subsequently helped the INGO obtain legal status in the country—in 2016, one of the INGO's local partner organizations faced a noticeably smooth registration process because of its work with the government.[^33] Other INGOs pursue similar strategies, inviting government staff, officials, police, and judges to serve in advisory positions on specific projects and programs and encouraging bureaucrats to participate in stakeholder meetings, with the explicit goal of increasing their influence and standing with key decision makers.[^34] Thus, when they enjoy sufficient flexibility, INGOs can harness and shape direct government involvement in their favor, pushing back against—and even reversing—regime attempts to shift or tame organizational missions and ideals.

## Program capture: regulating operations

The legal environment dictates more than just the registration requirements for INGOs. Laws regarding NGO operations give governments control over some aspects of their advocacy and programming. This control is sometimes accidental and indirect. For instance, an orphanage working in Central Asia reports regularly getting locked into programs because of bureaucratic inefficiency. Their host country requires that all international NGOs dealing with orphans fully fund all children for a full calendar year. However, their donor sponsorship funds are collected irregularly and can sometimes disappear, leading to difficult financial decisions:

> We are not allowed by the … government to withdraw the names of orphans sponsored until the end of each year even if we did not receive funding for that orphan but we still must pay for that orphan until the end of each year.[^35]

This regulation puts substantial strain on the organization's resources and allows the government to force the orphanage to dip into its general fund to guarantee its services. Other respondents report similar instances where host governments use bureaucratic delays and rules to lock INGOs into their programs.[^36] This indirect form of control allows the government to guarantee access to INGO services regardless of donor cash flow, but imposes significant financial burdens on those INGOs.

Government involvement can also be more overt. Rules can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^37] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^38] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^39] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.

The government of Rwanda consider our organization as its name due to our work on promoting human rights. For the past 10 years, Rwanda has a high record in human rights abuses, freedom of expression is non-existent and freedom of peaceful assembly is controlled by government officials.  The only reason we can keep working in those situations, is because we are Rwandans and we have the right to work in our home country, however, it is not safe as we are always dealing with the government official and some of our staff are not allowed to work in Rwanda.

As IDC receives no funding from the Australian government, this enables us to fully pursue our mission, and enjoy all legal avenues of freedom of speech. When sub-granting some aspects of our work to international partners, we are bound to comply with financial transfer and money laundering legislation.
